          Easy things to code in Mathomatic that seem like good ideas
          -----------------------------------------------------------

Make the limit command copy to a new equation, instead of modifying the current
equation.

Add fractional integration to the integrate command.  When "order" is negative,
it will naturally do fractional differentiation.

Add "combine variable" command that combines all stored equations and solves
for the specified variable.  First, the equation containing the variable must
be found and made the current equation.  This is done by searching backwards,
starting at the current equation.  Then something similar to a repeated
"eliminate all" (excepting the specified variable), that doesn't re-use
equations, is done with the current equation.  Lastly, solve for the variable
and display.

Simplify nested radicals like ((9 + 4*(2^.5))^.5) to (1 + 2*(2^.5)).  This may
be difficult, I have no idea how this is done.  Heuristics are not acceptable
for this.
