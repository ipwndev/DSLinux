                      Mathomatic Installation Instructions
                      ------------------------------------

The requirements for easy installation from source are the Unix or GNU make
utility and the GCC C compiler.  Other C compilers may be used, but may require
slight modification of the makefile and sources.  You will need to open a shell
window to compile and run Mathomatic.  You need root (super-user) permissions
to install Mathomatic.

A typical installation is done by typing the following at the shell prompt:

	make READLINE=1
	make test
	sudo make install

This will compile, test, and install the Mathomatic executable and docs in
"/usr/local" in less than a minute.  Type "mathomatic" at the shell prompt to
run Mathomatic.  If Mathomatic doesn't run, check that the shell "PATH"
environment variable includes "/usr/local/bin".

If "sudo" doesn't work, use:

	su -c "make install"

To completely remove Mathomatic from the system, type:

	sudo make uninstall
