; Here are some financial formulas that can be "read" into Mathomatic:

; Compound Interest Future Value Formula:
f_v1 = p_v*(1+i)^n

; Annuity Formula:
f_v2 = p*(((1+i)^n-1)/i)
; Next we will combine these to produce that Amortized Loan Formula.
pause
; Amortized Loan Formula (Mortgage Formula):
f_v1 = f_v2
eliminate all
p ; solve for p
; p_v = present value
; f_v = future value (maturity value)
; i = interest rate per period
; n = number of periods
; p = payment per period
