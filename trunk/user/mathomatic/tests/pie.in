; This is the famous Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) algorithm.
; Sum this n = 0 to infinity to compute pi.
; This is especially useful for calculating pi in hexadecimal.
; One hexadecimal digit of pi is generated with each iteration.

((4/((8*n) + 1)) - (2/((8*n) + 4)) - (1/((8*n) + 5)) - (1/((8*n) + 6)))/(16^n)
simplify
sum n 0 10 ; Sum as n goes from 0 to 10.
pi ; Verify that the digits are the same.
x^n/n! ; Sum this n = 0 to infinity to compute (e^x).
replace x with 1 ; Sum this n = 0 to infinity to compute e:
sum n 0 20 ; Sum as n goes from 0 to 20.
e ; Verify that the digits are the same.
