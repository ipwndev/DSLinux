; Tests for the experimental limit command.

clear all
; find the derivative of 1/(x^.5) using the difference quotient:
(1/(x+h)^.5-1/x^.5)/h
limit h 0 ; take the limit as h goes to 0
integrate x ; take the anti-derivative to see if it's right

; test infinity limits:
(3x+100-a)/(x-b)
limit x inf ; answer should be 3

(((x^2) - (5*x) + 6)^(1/2)) - x
limit x inf ; answer should be -5/2

x*((x^2+1)^.5-x)
limit x inf ; answer should be 1/2
