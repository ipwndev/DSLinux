; This is a general equation for an ellipse that was created using the rule
; that the sum of the distances (k) from any point on the perimeter (x, y)
; to the two foci: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is a constant (k).  This can
; represent any ellipse of any orientation on the Cartesian plane.

k = ((((x1-x)^2)+((y1-y)^2))^0.5)+((((x2-x)^2)+((y2-y)^2))^0.5)

; The equation for an ellipse centered at the origin of the Cartesian plane:

1=x^2/radius1^2+y^2/radius2^2
