               --------------------------------------------------

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.0:

8/08/06 - Add "makefile.lib", the Mathomatic symbolic math library makefile.

8/09/06 - "replace constants" command now approximates constants with roots.

8/09/06 - Tweak code command.

8/12/06 - Fixed a floating point accuracy issue recently introduced.

8/13/06 - Properly fixed the above accuracy issue.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.1:

8/20/06 - Fixed many very minor bugs.  Added variable display precision.

8/21/06 - Display single digit primes when using "matho-primes pal".

8/24/06 - Increase display precision from 12 to 14 decimal digits.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.2:

8/27/06 - Added some tiny python programs: "fact/factorial" and "primes/mult".

8/31/06 - Add alternate command name "display" to flist command.

9/04/06 - Improve eliminate command by allowing "eliminate all all ..." to
          eliminate all variables two or more times.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.3:

9/06/06 - Remove "doc/notes.html", it is not my best work.

9/08/06 - Improve the Mathomatic manuals.

9/09/06 - Fix sign bug for negative factorials (gamma function).
          "-1.5!" now evaluates to -3.544907701811 instead of 3.544907701811.

9/10/06 - Rename "fact" directory to "factorial".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.4:

10/01/06 - Improve user interface of solve command.

10/01/06 - Add alternate command syntax for sum and product commands.
           "sum x = 0 to 10" works the same as "sum x 0 10".

10/08/06 - Add "-r" option, which disables readline input processing.

10/08/06 - Corrected "tests/cubic.in" and fixed incomplete simplification
           in complex root calculation.

10/10/06 - Got rid of the special "temp" variable.

10/11/06 - Got rid of the special "answer" and "integer" variables.
           They are now normal variables.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.5:

10/14/06 - Fix optimize command.  Now works 100% properly for "tests/cubic.in".

10/16/06 - Made HTML division lines look better using "&mdash;".

10/17/06 - Made list_equation() and list_expression() more efficient by
           converting the strcat(3)s to strcpy(3)s with a macro.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.6:

10/27/06 - Tune-up of the Mathomatic HTML documentation.

10/28/06 - Add a warning when complex root approximation is done.

10/30/06 - Add another global temporary expression space to make the calculate command
           iteration terminate on convergence and make the limit command copy to a new
           equation space.

11/02/06 - Improve help command by displaying alternate command names.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.7:

11/10/06 - Add "set autocalc" option.

12/08/06 - Fix limit command so it fails instead of giving wrong answers.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.8:

12/16/06 - Add "set special_variable_character" option.

12/26/06 - Comment makefiles and add "INSTALL.txt" for first-time users.

12/31/06 - Add "primes/primorial" Python program.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.9:

2/10/07 - "make install" wasn't working - fixed.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.10:

2/24/07 - Allow calculating large powers of complex numbers at the prompt, like (i#+1)^99.

3/06/07 - Display which color mode is in effect on startup of Mathomatic.

3/08/07 - Some minor interface improvements to the taylor command.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.11:

Code cleanup and documentation touch-ups.

3/31/07 - Corrected limit command for infinity limits.

4/3/07 - Updated root "README.txt" and created "tests/limits.in".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.6.12:

Code cleanup and documentation touch-ups.

4/16/07 - Remove GPL preamble in "primes/*.c", so everything is LGPL.

4/26/07 - Allow entering "e#" and "i#" as "e" and "i".  Display "e", "i", and "pi" as "e#", "i#", and "pi#".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.7.0:

4/30/07 - Require a space between command and command line, so variables don't get confused with commands.  This is a bug fix.

5/5/07 - Added a directory named "hard_stuff".

5/10/07 - Fixed error in "tests/finance.in".
