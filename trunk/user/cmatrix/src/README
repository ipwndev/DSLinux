CMatrix - show a scrolling 'Matrix' like screen in Linux (curses based)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMatrix Homepage - be sure to check out the latest version =-)

To compile the program, type 'make'.

CMatrix by default operates in 'eye candy' mode.  It must be aborted with
control-c or 'q'.  If you wish for more of a 'screen saver' effect, you
must specify -s on the command line.  For usage, use cmatrix -h.

  To get the program to look most like the movie, use cmatrix -lba
  To get the program to look most like the Win/Mac screensaver, use
  cmatrix -ol

   You'll probably need a decent ncurses library to get this to work. I
have provided a binary that depends on ncurses 4.2 & glibc6.
   If you have any suggestions/flames/patches to send, please feel free to
do so.  Please do not critique my code, I know I'm a hack ;-)  I just got
the urge to write this one evening, and decided to see how fast I could do
it.  It's probably not particularly portable or efficient, but I'm pretty
sure it wont hog *too* much CPU time.
