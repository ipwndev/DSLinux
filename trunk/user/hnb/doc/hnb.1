.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBhnb\fP hierarchical notebook.

\fBhnb\fP is an ncurses program to organize many kinds of data in one place, for
example addresses, todo lists, ideas, book reviews or to store snippets of
brainstorming, to make a structured packing list or just to take random notes. 
It can export ascii/html/latex/postscript, supports todo checkboxes, checkbox
trees with percentages and searching.

\fBhnb\fP uses a simple ascii file for storing your notes. This file can be
