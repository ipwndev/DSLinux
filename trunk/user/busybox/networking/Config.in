config CONFIG_IFUPDOWN
	bool "ifupdown"
	default n
	help
	  Activate or deactivate the specified interfaces.  This applet makes
	  use of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
	  configure network interfaces.  Therefore, you will probably also want
	  to enable either CONFIG_IFCONFIG and CONFIG_ROUTE, or enable
	  CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various CONFIG_IP options.  Of
	  course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
	  against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
	  of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
	  enable these additional options.  It is up to you to supply either
	  "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command, either via busybox or via
	  standalone utilities.

config CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP
	bool "  Use ip applet"
	default n

	select CONFIG_FEATURE_IP_LINK
	select CONFIG_FEATURE_IP_ROUTE
	help
	  Use the busybox iproute "ip" applet to implement "ifupdown".

	  If leave this disabled, you must install the full-blown iproute2
	  utility or the  "ifup" and "ifdown" applets will not work.

config CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP_BUILTIN
	bool "  Use busybox ifconfig and route applets"
	default y
	depends on CONFIG_IFUPDOWN && !CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP
	select CONFIG_IFCONFIG
	select CONFIG_ROUTE
	help
	  Use the busybox iproute "ifconfig" and "route" applets to
	  implement the "ifup" and "ifdown" utilities.

	  If leave this disabled, you must install the full-blown ifconfig
	  and route utilities, or the  "ifup" and "ifdown" applets will not
	  work.

config CONFIG_TELNETD

	default n
	help
	  A daemon for the TELNET protocol, allowing you to log onto the host
	  running the daemon.  Please keep in mind that the TELNET protocol
	  sends passwords in plain text.  If you can't afford the space for an
	  SSH daemon and you trust your network, you may say 'y' here.  As a
	  more secure alternative, you should seriously consider installing the
	  very small Dropbear SSH daemon instead:
		http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

	  Note that for busybox telnetd to work you need several things:
	  First of all, your kernel needs:
		  CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
		  CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y

	  Next, you need a /dev/pts directory on your root filesystem:

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	  Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	  Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	  Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	  You need to be sure that Busybox has CONFIG_LOGIN and
	  CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID enabled.  And finally, you should make
	  certain that Busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox
		chmod 4755 /bin/busybox

	  with all that done, telnetd _should_ work....


config CONFIG_FEATURE_TELNETD_INETD
	bool "  Support call from inetd only"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_TELNETD
	help
	  Selecting this will make telnetd only callable from inetd,
	  removing the standalone support.

config CONFIG_FEATURE_TFTP_DEBUG
	bool "  Enable debug"
	default n
	depends on CONFIG_TFTP

	  into problems with tftp as the protocol doesn't help you much when
	  you run into problems.

config CONFIG_TRACEROUTE
	bool "traceroute"
	default n
	help
	  Utility to trace the route of IP packets

config CONFIG_FEATURE_TRACEROUTE_VERBOSE
