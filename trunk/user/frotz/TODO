Rework os_process_arguments() in src/curses/ux_init.c to make Frotz more
convenient to use as a BBS door or MUD module.

Add mouse support through.  Not sure how useful this would be, but
someone did ask.

Remove debug options from command line.  They should be set through the
hotkey menu instead

Hotkey menu needs work.

Blink the screen instead of ringing the bell when in quiet mode.

Add zlib support to allow Frotz to read gzipped story files.

Add support for debug verbs (teleport, pilfer, bamf, (frotz|futz|lumen),
tail, travis, lummox, systolic, lingo, spiel, rooms, items, omap,
embezzle).  I really like the Rezrov's cheat functions.

Give the hotmenu a full ncurses-based interface.  This would allow MUCH
more flexibility in configuring Frotz.

More sensible handling of saves, transcripts, and game files.

Curses menu to select desired game.  Current working code heavily
borrowed from Alan Shutko's <ats@hubert.wustl.edu> "int-fiction"
frontend program.

Blorb gamefile support.

Blorb sound support on all platforms.  Full support will probably
require a sound driver which can accept multiple inputs simultanously
(such as esound or ALSA).

An X11 graphical interface using GTK widgets (thus allowing V6 full support).

Cocoa support for OSX.
