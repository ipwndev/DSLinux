If you make a change to wnc, the easiest way to test is to to run the
test/testwnc.sh script by typing "sh test/testwnc.sh".

Should NOT be done as a user that has write access to anything valuable!!

testwnc.sh assumes that you have a patched version of msh
in your PATH.
If you don't, get busybox (last version tested is 1.2.0),
apply test/msh.c.diff and build busybox with only msh enabled.
Rename the busybox executable to msh and copy it somewhere in your path.

The testwnc.sh script uses sed and overrides the PATH to "simulate"
iwlist scan, wfcdump and /etc/rc.d/network.

Profile settings are stored in /tmp/wncsh when using testwnc.sh.

If msh gives you a syntax error with no explanation, then you can try
testing with ksh instead. To do this search for ksh in wnc.sh and comment
out any lines marked "for ksh testing", then run "sh test/testwnc.sh ksh".

wnc is *not* compatible with bash or pdksh (see wnc.sh for details).

To use a wnc profile with /etc/rc.d/network, you can put something like this in rc.conf:
 NETWORK_CONFIG="/var/wncsh/profiles/myprofile"
