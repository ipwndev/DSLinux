NAME
       replimenu - A small menu-system.

VERSION
       0.9

SYNOPSIS
       replimenu -h|-V
       replimenu  -f  menufile [-c colorscheme] [-q] [-g WxH] [-a
       item_names...] [-e i]

DESCRIPTION
       replimenu  is  a  small  GNU  GPL'ed  menu-system   mainly
       intended   for  use  in  shell  installation/configuration
       scripts, escpecially  in  an  environment  where  size  is
       important,  e.g.  embedded systems.  replimenu doesn't use
       (n)curses, something that results in small size  and  less
       hazzle.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9
       On  slow  consoles  (e.g. VESA framebuffer) the menu would
       flicker whenever moving up/down the  menu,  this  has  now
       been  fixed  (with a dirty hack). I have also added a fea-
       ture: inputboxes, msgboxes and yesnoboxes can now  have  a
       multi-line  message  in them. Separate the string in icap-
       tion with a \n to break lines. Unfortunately, lines  don't
       wrap.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.8 (0.8.1)
       Bug fixes.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7
       Incorporated  some features found in a patch for replimenu
       0.3 contributed by Paul Whittaker, made  for  his  DIET-PC
       project  (http://diet-pc.sf.net/).   The features include:
       Spacebar has the same effect as return on  checkboxes  and
       radiobuttons. Added one new type, defaultfromenv.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6
       Five  new  types; hidden, password, chain, auto and msgbox
       -- and one new variable; exitafterauto.  The  characteris-
       tics  of  the  notempty type has been changed, it will now
       keep show the inputbox until the user has entered  a  non-
       empty string. Also, three new command line options; -g, -a
       and -e. One bug that caused segfaults has also been  found
       and resolved.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5
       You  may  specify  a  custom  caption (using icaption) for
       input boxes and yesno (ask) types instead of the label  of
       the menu item.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4
       You  may now use `dummy' items both first and last (previ-
       ously un-supported).

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3
       Since 0.3 you have the ability to play  with  exit  codes.
       The  return  code from the runonexit variable is passed to
       the exit code of replimenu. You  may  also  execute  other
       `runonexit'  commands  by  defining a command variable for
       menu items named `QUIT'. The exit code of  these  commands
       are also passed to replimenu. Yet another feature is to be
       able to execute the runonexit command before or after  the
       command  in  a  `QUIT' item, including choosing which exit
       code to use. This is all  done  with  the  runonexitfirst,
       runonexitlast,   usecommandretval  and  nocls  types.  The
       default is not to execute the runonexit command in  `QUIT'
       menu  items  that have a non-empty command variable. There
       are two new variables in 0.3, br and nocls.

HOW IT WORKS
       In order to define a menu you have to write a menu config-
       uration  file, menufile.  This file holds the entire menu;
       items, commands, caption text, colour, etc.

       Command line options

       -f filename
              This is the only obligatory  option.   filename  is
              the name of a menu configuration file.

       -c colorscheme
              colorscheme  is  a  number  from  0 to 9 (currently
              available colour-schemes), this will  override  the
              configuration file's colour-scheme (if any).

       -q     This  option  will  prevent  the user from quitting
              replimenu, not even  a  SIGTERM/SIGINT  will  quit.
              However, a menu item named QUIT will still quit the
              menu.

       -g WxH Force a geometry. This  will  prevent  the  ioctl()
              TIOCGWINSZ request to figure out the current termi-
              nal size. It's useful  for,  e.g.  telnet  sessions
              that  don't  DO  NAWS.  You may also consider using
              stty cols 80 rows 25  on  TTY:s  (or  pseudo-tty:s)
              that  are  uninitialized. E.g.: replimenu -f fu.bar
              -g 80x25.

       -a item_names...
              A comma (,) separated list of menu  item  names  to
              automatically  execute on start-up, e.g.: replimenu
              -f fu.bar -a fubar,snafu.

       -e i   Set the `exitafterauto' flag. i is an integer (only
              0  or  1  makes  sense).   Can  be used with the -a
              option. This option overrides  the  `exitafterauto'
              variable in the menufile. E.g.: replimenu -f fu.bar
              -a fubar,snafu -e1  (will  auto-execute  the  items
              named fubar and snafu then exit replimenu).

       -h     Help.

       -V     Print version and exit immediately.

MENU CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  menufile  basically  consists  of two areas, a global
       where you specify caption text, colour-scheme, textindent,
       etc.  and  one  where  you define the menu items and their
       commands. All definitions are done in the manner of  vari-
       able=value.  Please  note  that  you can not (yet) specify
       multi-line variables (using e.g. a trailing \).

       Menufile variables

              caption
                     The text that should appear in  the  caption
                     on the first row.

              text   The  text  that  should  appear in the body,
                     right before the menu.  This  overrides  the
                     environment variable REPLIMENU_TEXT.

              aftertext
                     The  text that should appear after the menu,
                     just above the  copyright-line.  This  over-
                     rides   the   environment   variable  REPLI-
                     MENU_AFTERTEXT.

              textindent
                     On what column the text in text should start
                     on the screen, default is 2.

              aftertextindent
                     On  what column the text in aftertext should
                     start on the screen, default is 2.

              colorscheme
                     Which colour-scheme to use,  default  is  0.
                     Available colour-schemes are 0 to 9.

              runonexit
                     What  command to run when exiting replimenu.

              br     An alias for  a  dummy-type  structure  (see
                     below). You may use this to easily put space
                     or comments between menu items. You may also
                     use dummy, an alias for br.

              nocls  This variable, defined alone without option,
                     will prevent  replimenu  from  clearing  the
                     screen  upon exit. For `QUIT' menu items you
                     must use the nocls type, as the default  for
                     `QUIT'  menu  items  is  to always clear the
                     screen.

              exitafterauto
                     Defined alone without parameters this  vari-
                     able will tell replimenu to exit immediately
                     after running through menu  items  with  the
                     auto  type  set.  If there are no auto types
                     available, replimenu will not exit.  Because
                     the  exit  is like pressing Q, runonexit can
                     be used together with this option.

              begin menuitem
                     Indicates the start of a  menu  item  struc-
                     ture.  This  can  also be begin item, define
                     item or start item.

                      name   The name of the menu item.  If  name
                             is  QUIT  then this menu item can be
                             used to quit replimenu.

                      label  The label text  that  will  visually
                             appear in the menu.

                     icaption
                             Only  for  input  boxes  and `yesno'
                             (`ask')  types.  You  may  use  this
                             variable  to  optionally  specify  a
                             different caption than label.

                      bullet The icon next  to  the  label  text,
                             defaults to NUMBERED which will enu-
                             merate each menu item  according  to
                             their position, starting from 1.

                      type   The type and characteristics of this
                             menu item. The variables  below  can
                             be  OR'd  together to shape the item
                             differently (e.g. pause | input).

                             regular
                                    A regular menu item, that is,
                                    it  will  execute the command
                                    and return. This  will  over-
                                    ride any other value.

                             ask    Will  ask  whether to execute
                                    this command or not. Can also
                                    be yesno.

                             input  Will  produce  a  pop-up  box
                                    with  an  input  field.   The
                                    user's  input  will be passed
                                    to the  environment  variable
                                    RM_INPUT,  that  is,  you can
                                    use it in the  command  vari-
                                    able. Can also be inputbox.

                             pause  This  will  present  a prompt
                                    just after a command  returns
                                    and  force  the user to press
                                    any key to continue.

                             msgbox Or  messagebox,  displays   a
                                    simple  one  line message box
                                    with an "OK-button".

                             variable
                                    Or var, changes  the  charac-
                                    teristics  of  the  menu item
                                    entirely. This makes the item
                                    a   variable,   basically  an
                                    inputbox without  a  command.
                                    The    environment   variable
                                    RM_name is set (where name is
                                    the name of the menu item) to
                                    the value of the variable. If
                                    variable   is  used  together
                                    with ask then the  value  can
                                    only   be  yes  or  no.  When
                                    replimenu   is    initialized
                                    RM_name  is  set to the value
                                    of default.

                             checkbox
                                    Or    option,    creates    a
                                    selectable  menu  item.  When
                                    the item has  an  X  in  it's
                                    checkbox    the   environment
                                    variable RM_name will be  set
                                    to  the  value of default. If
                                    the  item  is  not  selected,
                                    RM_name will not exist in the
                                    environment. name is  changed
                                    to  the  actual  name  of the
                                    menu item. This item  can  be
                                    used  together with selected.

                             radiobutton
                                    Or radio. This menu  item  is
                                    for   creating  an  array  of
                                    selectable items  where  only
                                    one   of  the  items  can  be
                                    selected. To use  this  item,
                                    each   radiobutton  that  you
                                    want to be part of  the  same
                                    array  must  share  the  same
                                    name, and each must have dif-
                                    ferent  default  values. When
                                    an item is  selected  RM_name
                                    (name  is changed to the name
                                    of  the  item)  is   set   to
                                    default.  This  item  can  be
                                    used together with  selected.

                             selected
                                    To   be  used  together  with
                                    checkbox   or    radiobutton,
                                    makes  the  item  selected by
                                    default.

                             setenvrmitem
                                    Or setenvitem, sets the envi-
                                    ronment  variable  RM_ITEM to
                                    this menu item's name on exe-
                                    cution of the command.

                             defaultfromenv
                                    Or defaultfromenvironment, or
                                    simply dfenv. If the  default
                                    field  is  empty, this option
                                    will cause replimenu to  look
                                    for RM_name (name is the name
                                    of the menu item)  among  the
                                    environment  variables, if it

                                    it's  value  as  the  default
                                    value.

                             runonexitfirst
                                    This is only  applicable  for
                                    menu    items   named   QUIT.
                                    runonexitfirst   (or   simply
                                    runonexit)  will  execute the
                                    runonexit command before exe-
                                    cuting  the command specified
                                    for the `QUIT' menu item.  In
                                    order  to  use this, the com-
                                    mand variable for the  `QUIT'
                                    item  must  not be empty. The
                                    default  behaviour  of   this
                                    option  is  to  exit with the
                                    exit code  of  the  runonexit
                                    command. You may choose which
                                    exit code to use by  specify-
                                    ing the usecommandretval type
                                    (e.g.  runonexitfirst|usecom-
                                    mandretval).

                             runonexitlast
                                    Same  as  above, only execute
                                    the runonexit  command  last.
                                    The default behaviour of this
                                    option is to  exit  with  the
                                    exit  code  of  the runonexit
                                    command. You may choose which
                                    exit  code to use by specify-
                                    ing the usecommandretval type
                                    (e.g.  runonexitfirst|usecom-
                                    mandretval).

                             usecommandretval
                                    Will tell  replimenu  to  use
                                    the  exit code of the command
                                    in a `QUIT' menu item instead
                                    of the runonexit code.

                             nocls  This type is specifically for
                                    `QUIT' menu  items.  It  pre-
                                    vents replimenu from clearing
                                    the screen upon exit.

                             hidden This type  will  prevent  the
                                    menu   item   from   visually
                                    appearing in the  menu.  It's
                                    still  useful  as  a  regular
                                    menu item, but only as either
                                    a  variable or as a member of
                                    a chain.

                             chain  If you wish  to  chain,  that
                                    is, tie the current menu item
                                    together with the  next  menu
                                    item.  By pressing enter on a
                                    menu item with the chain type
                                    the  following menu item will
                                    also be executed (as  if  one
                                    pressed  the  next  menu item
                                    consecutively). It is  mainly
                                    useful  together  with hidden
                                    types where  only  the  first
                                    chained item is visible.

                             password
                                    Or  simply  passwd. This will
                                    tell an input  type  to  show
                                    stars  (*)  instead of actual
                                    characters.

                             auto   Also autoexec.  Automatically
                                    execute  this  menu  item  on
                                    start-up.  Every  menu   item
                                    marked  auto will be executed
                                    consecutively until there are
                                    no  auto  types  left to exe-
                                    cute.  You  may   also   make
                                    replimenu  exit once the auto
                                    run    is    complete,    see
                                    exitafterauto.

                             notempty
                                    Don't  allow  a  variable  or
                                    input box value to be  empty.
                                    If  the  user enters an empty
                                    string   in    an    inputbox
                                    (including   var  type  input
                                    boxes)  replimenu  will  keep
                                    show the inputbox and ask for
                                    input   until   a   non-empty
                                    string has been entered.

                             dummy  The  characteristics  of  the
                                    dummy type has  been  changed
                                    since  version  0.2.  You may
                                    now use it to  separate  menu
                                    items  from  each  other  or,
                                    e.g. add text  above  a  menu
                                    item. See the example config-
                                    uration file below.

                     default
                             The default value of this menu item.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       All  RM_  variables  can  be  used when executing commands
       within the menu.

       RM_ITEM
              If setenvrmitem is specified then  this  variable's
              value will be the name of the menu item.

       RM_INPUT
              The value of an inputbox.

       RM_name
              In variables, checkboxes and radiobuttons, the name
              is replaced with the item's name. This is a  global
              variable, it can be used in every item in the menu.

       REPLIMENU_TEXT
              Same as the text variable in  the  menu  file.  The
              value  of this variable will be printed in the body
              before the menu.

       REPLIMENU_AFTERTEXT
              Same as the aftertext variable in  the  menu  file.
              The  value  of this variable will be printed in the
              body after the menu.

NAVIGATION
       You may use the arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down,  Home  and
       End  to navigate the menu. When an inputbox or an ask item
       is displayed you may press ESC two times to cancel. Press-
       ing  F10 or Q will quit the menu (unless the -q option was
       specified).

BUGS
       Certainly. Report bugs to replichaun@zebra.ath.cx,  please
       be  as  specific  as  possible  and  explain for me how to
       repeat the bug.
