.SH NAME
pam_winbind \- PAM module for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBsamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
pam_winbind is a PAM module that can authenticate users against the local domain by talking to the Winbind daemon\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
pam_winbind supports several options:

.TP
debug
Gives debugging output to syslog\&.

.TP
require_membership_of=[SID or NAME]
If this option is set, pam_winbind will only succeed if the user is a member of the given SID or NAME\&. A SID can be either a group\-SID, a alias\-SID or even a user\-SID\&. It is also possible to give a NAME instead of the SID\&. That name must have the form: \fIMYDOMAIN\\mygroup\fR or\fIMYDOMAIN\\myuser\fR\&. pam_winbind will, in that case, lookup the SID internally\&. Note that NAME may not contain any spaces\&. It is thus recommended to only use SIDs\&. You can verify the list of SIDs a user is a member of with \fBwbinfo \-\-user\-sids=SID\fR\&.

.TP
try_first_pass


.TP
use_first_pass
By default, pam_winbind tries to get the authentication token from a previous module\&. If no token is available it asks the user for the old password\&. With this option, pam_winbind aborts with an error if no authentication token from a previous module is available\&.

.TP
use_authtok
Set the new password to the one provided by the previously stacked password module\&. If this option is not set pam_winbind will ask the user for the new password\&.
