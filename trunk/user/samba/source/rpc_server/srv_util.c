/*  this module apparently provides an implementation of DCE/RPC over a
 *  named pipe (IPC$ connection using SMBtrans).  details of DCE/RPC
 *  documentation are available (in on-line form) from the X-Open group.
 *
 *  this module should provide a level of abstraction between SMB
 *  and DCE/RPC, while minimising the amount of mallocs, unnecessary
 *  data copies, and network traffic.
 *
 *  in this version, which takes a "let's learn what's going on and
 *  get something running" approach, there is additional network
 *  traffic generated, but the code should be easier to understand...
 *
 *  ... if you read the docs.  or stare at packets for weeks on end.
