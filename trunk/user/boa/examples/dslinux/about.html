		What is DSlinux? DSlinux is a project that aims to port Linux to the Nintendo DS gaming console.<br>
		But what does that mean? Simply said it's running linux on your Nintendo DS. <i>"But why"</i> you ask? Simple,
		 Linux has a big fan base and can be run on pretty much anything. DSlinux has been worked on for
		 quite some time now and great progress has been made. For example it is now possible to surf 
		the web using your DS via DSlinux, fetch your E-mail and rss feeds, play simple text-based games, etc..
		 Better still is that one can make/port applications to DSlinux that were originally made for desktop Linux
 		systems. That way applications can added relativly easily.<br>
		<br>
		If you can run homebrew on the DS it is most likely you can also run DSlinux. Getting homebrew to run isn't 
		very difficult anymore. It requires you to buy a bit of hardware and that's it. DSlinux is now even capable 
		of utilising some hardware to have 36Mb of RAM (memory) as apposed to the standard 4Mb RAM available in the DS!
		 This page is very basic and gives only a general idea of what DSlinux is, but if you want to learn more go 
		over to the <a target="_blank" href="http://dslinux.org">DSlinux website</a> at
