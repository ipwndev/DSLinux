Synopsis:
   submenu <parent menu name> <new menu name> <options> "Submenu Text"

Description:
   SUBMENU appends a new submenu to the parent menu given.  A new
   menu with the new menu name given is created. Possible options:
        -s = shared
        -r = right (items appear on the right of the menubar - unimplemented)
        -b = break (greates a vertical break)
        -f = framed (PM only - thin line around text)
   Submenu text is the text that appears on the menu which spawns the new
   menu.  If a ~ is placed before a charater in the text an accellerator
   is created for that character.  (i.e. ALT-character will activate that
   submenu)
