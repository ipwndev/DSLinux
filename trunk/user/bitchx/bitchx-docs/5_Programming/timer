Synopsis:
   timer [-refnum <num|name>] [-repeat <times>] <seconds> [<action>]
   timer -delete [all]|[<num>]
 
Description:
   This command allows the client to store arbitrary commands scheduled
   for execution at some specified number of seconds in the future. Any
   number of timers may be set, and any number of commands may be used
   in a timer.  Timers with multiple commands must have those commands
   surrounded by curly braces.

   All timers are assigned a reference number to distinguish them from
   each other.  A specific reference number may be specified, though the
   number may not be one that is already in use, and it must be either a
   non-negative integer or a string of no more than 10 characters (longer
   strings will be silently truncated).  The reference number or name is
   also used to delete a timer.  Using the TIMER command with no
   arguments will display the list of pending timers.

   When used with -repeat, the timer will only expire after running through
   <times> number of times.

Options:
   -delete <num>|all    delete the numbered timer, or all timers
   -list                same as using no arguments; lists all timers
   -refnum <num|name>   set a timer with the given reference number or name
   -repeat <times>      cycle through the timer <times> times before expiring
   -update              re-assign the timer with new values
   -window <windesc>    specifies in which window the timer should go off
   
Examples:
   To create a reminder that X Files will be on in 10 minutes:
      timer 600 {
         beep
         echo *** X Files is on!
         echo *** Why are you still on irc?!
      }

   To assign a specific refnum to that timer:
      timer -ref 103 600 { ... }
      timer -ref foo 600 { ... }

   This timer's reference name will be truncated to "foobarbooy":
      timer -ref foobarbooya 45 { ... }

   To delete all pending timers:
      timer -d all

Other Notes:
   EPIC attempts to keep track of which server and window each timer was
   started from.  Each timer will be reverted back to that window and server
   when it expires.
