Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]dcc_chat [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a message across a
   DCC CHAT connection.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of the message sender
   $1-   message received

   dcc(1) chat; msg(1); on(5) send_dcc_chat

Other Notes:
   DCC falls outside of the irc protocol, and as such there are no
   restrictions on automated replies.  This creates the potential for
   uncontrolled looping, so caution is advised.
