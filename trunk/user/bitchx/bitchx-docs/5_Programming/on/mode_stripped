Synopsis:
   on [#][<mode>]mode_stripped [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is similar to the MODE hook, except it only hooks a single
   mode change at a time.  This hook relies on MODE_STRIPPER being turned
   on.  It is mostly useful in scripts that wish to evaluate each
   individual mode change.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of person issuing mode change
   $1    channel or nickname affected by mode change
   $2    mode changed
   $3    argument to the mode (does not apply to all modes)

See Also:
   mode(1); on(5) mode; set(4) mode_stripper

Other Notes:
   This hook does not override the MODE hook; rather, they compliment each
   other.
