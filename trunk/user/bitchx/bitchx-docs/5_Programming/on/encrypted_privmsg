Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]encrypted_privmsg [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a MSG encrypted with
   CTCP SED.  This is how the ENCRYPT command normally works.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of message sender
   $1-   message received

Examples:
   To clearly distinguish encrypted MSGs from unencrypted ones:
      on ^encrypted_privmsg '% $N *' {
         echo *$0* V[CRYPT]V $2-
      }

See Also:
   encrypt(4); msg(1); on(5) encrypted_notice, msg

Restrictions:
   This hook is subject to the same protocol restrictions as the MSG
   hook.

Other Notes:
   When used with the silent or quiet modes, this hook will suppress the
   normal output for MSGs.  Care should be used, as it can also jumble
   public hooks.
