Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]pong [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a protocol PONG
   message.  Under normal circumstances, the sender will be a server.
   However, clients are also allowed to send PONG messages to each other.
   Since there is never any reason for a client to send a PONG to another
   client, this hook can be useful for blocking PONG floods.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname sending the PONG
   $1-   argument to PONG (usually the same as $0, but not necessarily)

Examples:
   To filter PONG messages from other clients:
      on ^pong "*" {
         if ( rmatch($0 %.%) ) echo *** Received protocol PONG from $0: $1-
      }
