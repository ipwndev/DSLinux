Synopsis:
   fe (<list>) <variable> [<variable> ...] { <actions> }

Description:
   FE is one of several loop types available in ircII-EPIC.  This loop
   takes a list of items, and for each one, it performs the specified
   action.

   It may act on more than one item at a time.  The list may be a plain
   text list, a variable, a function, or any combination.  As with aliases
   and other control structures, the braces surrounding the action may
   appear anywhere.  List items are whitespace-delimited.  Extended words
   (those with spaces in them) are honored when they are surrounded in
   double quotes (").

   For instance, FE might be used to loop through a list of nicknames
   that the user wishes to invite to a channel (or kick from it!).

   Any looping mechanism can run through a list one by one.  The real
   power of FE is its ability to act on multiple list items at once.
   One could perform an action on 3 at a time, for instance, such as
   setting a +o channel mode on other users.  Other loops, such as FOR,
   can do this as well, but FE offers a more elegant solution.

Examples:
   A simple mode +o script to cluster mode changes 3 at a time:
      fe ( $friends ) xx yy zz {
         if ( zz ) {
            mode #blah +ooo $xx $yy $zz
         } {
            if ( yy ) {
               mode #blah +oo $xx $yy
            } {
               mode +o $xx
            }
         }
      }

   A script to check for upper-case letters in a line of input:
      @ caps = 0
      fec ( $* ) xx {
         if ( ascii($xx) >= 65 || ascii($xx) <= 90 ) {
            @ caps++
         }
      }
      echo *** Found $caps upper-case letters

Aliases:
   FEC works the same as FE, except it loops through each character in the
   list, not each word.  Whitespace is only valid if it is between two
   other non-whitespace characters.  Whitespace that follows the opening
   parenthesis, and that leads up to the closing one, is ignored.

See Also:
   for(5); foreach(5); until(5); while(5)

Other Notes:
   The loop doesn't necessarily have to have an action inside the curly
   braces.  It doesn't make much sense to omit it, though. Since 01/22/97,
   FE and FEC use local(6) variables instead of global.
