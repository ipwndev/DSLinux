Synopsis:
   comment [<anything>]

Description:
   This is exactly what it says, a comment.  It does nothing.  It is useful
   in scripts for explaining bits of code, adding disclaimers or copyright
   notices, etc.

   There are also several symbolic comments.  Both the # and : characters
   may be used to designate comments.  There is no functional difference
   between any of them.  Additionally, EPIC supports C /* */ multiline
   comments.

Examples:
   These are some comments:
      comment this was the first comment
      # this is a newer comment
      : this is a new comment too, but it isn't used much
      /* this is an elite comment unique to EPIC */

Restrictions:
   In order to facilitate the use of older scripts (those designed for old
   or non-EPIC clients), the default behavior is to recognize C-like
   comments only if they start at the beginning of a line.  This allows
   for '/*' sequence to appear in ECHOed text, etc.  This default can be
   changed to the traditional C behavior by setting COMMENT_HACK off.
   There is no restriction on where the closing '*/' may appear.  Also,
   unlike C, a command may not begin before a comment, and end after it;
   the /* */ effectively acts like a line terminator.

Other Notes:
   Executing an alias whose name begins with a '*' by calling it as '/*'
   will lose, as it will be interpreted as a comment.  The solution here is
   to limit alias names to alphanumeric characters.
