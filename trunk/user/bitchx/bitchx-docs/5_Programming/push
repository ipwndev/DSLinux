Synopsis:
   push <variable name> <word>
   pop  <variable name>

Description:
   PUSH appends the given word (or words) to the given variable, padded
   with a single space.  The variable name itself may not contain a
   leading '$'; the command uses the variable itself, not the expanded
   contents.  If the variable does not exist, it is created containing
   the given word(s) (just as if ASSIGN were used).

Aliases:
   POP is the exact opposite of PUSH, in that it pops off the last word
   in the variable.  If there is only one word in the variable, the
   variable is deleted.  Both PUSH and POP are functionally equivalent
   to the $push() and $pop() functions, respectively.
