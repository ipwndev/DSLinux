Synopsis:
   $umask(<mask>)

Technical:
   This function sets the default file umask used when creating and writing
   files with EPIC's builtin file functions.  The umask sets the permission
   bits to block when writing.  Essentially, the resultant permission bits
   would be the default minus the umask.

Practical:
   This function is used to set the default file permissions.  The $chmod()
   function is affected by it.

Returns:
   previous umask, or nothing if no new umask is given

Examples:
   $umask(77)                 sets default permissions to 700
   $umask(2)                  sets default permissions to 775
   $umask()                   error, no mask, returns nothing
