Synopsis:
   $convert(<ip address|hostname>)

Technical:
   This function does a DNS lookup on the given address.  For an IP address,
   it attempts to find the corresponding Internet hostname.  For a hostname,
   it attempts to find the corresponding IP address.

Practical:
   This function does effectively the same thing as $iptoname() and
   $nametoip().  It is mostly useful when you want to convert an address,
   but you aren't sure if the input will be an IP address or not.

Returns:
   IP address or hostname corresponding to input, or nothing on error

Examples:
   $convert(some.school.edu)       returns IP address for "some.school.edu"
   $convert(192.168.1.1)           returns hostname for "192.168.1.1"

   iptoname(6); nametoip(6)
