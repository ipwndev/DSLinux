Synopsis:
   $ischanop(<nick> <channel>)

Technical:
   This function tests whether the given user is a channel operator on the
   given channel.  It only functions for channels that you are currently
   on.

Practical:
   This function is used for seeing if someone is a channel operator on one
   of the channels you're on.  This might be useful for an script that
   gives out chanops to people, to avoid any redundant mode changes.

Returns:
   "true" value if user is a channel op, "false" if not or if error
