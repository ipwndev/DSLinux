Synopsis:
   $idle()

Technical:
   Returns your idle time.  Synonymous with $E.  Present for compatibility
   with the standard ircII 2.8.2 client.

Practical:
   This function is used to get your client's idle time.  It should be used
   in lieu of $E if you intend your script to be compatible with the stock
   ircII client.  Note that the client's concept of "idle time" is not
   necessarily the same as your server's (and in fact usually isn't).

Returns:
   number of seconds since last keypress
