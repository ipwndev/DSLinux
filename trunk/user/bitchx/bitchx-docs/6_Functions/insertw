Synopsis:
   $insertw(<index> <word> <text>)

Technical:
   This function inserts the given word into the given text, in the position
   indicated by the given index.  It returns the resultant string.  The
   index counts from 0 (zero).

Practical:
   This function is used when you want to insert a word into an existing
   text string (usually held in a variable).  This could be useful as a
   pseudo-unshift mechanism; using an index of 0 would yield the same
   results as $unshift(), but in truth any offset could be used (thus
   keeping the first few words intact, and unshifting the rest).

Returns:
   input text with word inserted

Examples:
   $insertw(1 blah hi there bob)       returns "hi blah there bob"
