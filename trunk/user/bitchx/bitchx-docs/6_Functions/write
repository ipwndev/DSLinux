Synopsis:
   $write(<fd> <text>)
   $writeb(<fd> <text>)

Technical:
   This function writes the given text to the given file descriptor.  A
   newline is automatically appended to the text.  The $writeb() variant
   does the same thing, except the newline is not automatically appended.

Practical:
   This function is useful for saving information to an external file.  It
   is most often used in scripts for saving configuration settings and the
   like.  The $writeb() function is useful for writing to binary files, or
   for writing lines to a file incrementally.

Returns:
     -1   if file descriptor does not exist
   > -1   number of bytes written (text length plus newline, if applicable)

Examples:
   $write(7 blah blah)                 writes "blah blah" plus NL to fd "7"
   $write(foo bar)                     "foo" not an fd, writes nothing
   $writeb(7 blah blah)                writes "blah blah" to fd "7"
   $writeb(foo bar)                    "foo" not an fd, writes nothing
