Synopsis:
   $word(<index> <list>)
   $notw(<index> <list>)

Technical:
   The $word() function returns the single word in the given list that has
   the given index in the list, counting from 0 (zero).  Its counterpart,
   $notw(), does exactly the opposite, returning the entire string, minus
   the indexed word (again counting from 0).

Practical:
   These functions are useful when you need to get (or hide) whatever word
   is in a particular position in a string of words.  It's mostly useful
   when you know that you always (or never) want the Xth word in the list,
   regardless of what it is.

Returns:
   word: indexed word
   notw: string without indexed word

Examples:
   $word(2 foo bar blah)                  returns "blah"
   $word(4 foo bar blah)                  returns nothing
   $word(-1 foo bar blah)                 returns nothing
   $notw(2 foo bar blah)                  returns "foo bar"
   $notw(4 foo bar blah)                  returns "foo bar blah"
   $notw(-1 foo bar blah)                 returns "foo bar blah"
