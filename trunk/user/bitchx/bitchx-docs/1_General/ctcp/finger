Synopsis:
   ctcp [=]<nick>|<channel> finger

Description:
   This will return the idle time of the client it is sent to, as well
   as the user's real name (from their system's /etc/passwd file).

See Also:
   load(5) finger

Other Notes:
   This is not the same as the Unix command of the same name.  Though it
   returns similar information (idle time, real name), the two have no
   relationship between one another.
