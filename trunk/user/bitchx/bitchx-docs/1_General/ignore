Synopsis:
   ignore [<nick | user@host>] [[-|+|^]<message type(s)>]
   ignore [<nick!user@host>]   [[-|+|^]<message type(s)>]
   ignore [<channel>]          [[-|+|^]<message type(s)>]

Description:
   The IGNORE command has two primary uses; filtering out messages that
   are unwanted, and highlighting messages of particular importance.  The
   default method is to filter messages out.

   Messages can be filtered based on any nick!user@host pattern, as well
   as just by nick (a "!*@*" will be appended to complete the pattern) or
   just by user@host (a "*!" will be prepended).  Messages can be filtered
   at the channel level, too.

   Messages can also be filtered based on context, so you could ignore all
   INVITEs from a person and still receive all other messages from that
   person.  Alter- nately, you could ignore all INVITEs from everyone except
   a specified person.

   IGNORE will apply a filter based on the best possible match.  Thus, if
   you are ignoring *!*@*.net and *!*foobar@*.slurpee.net, and someone
   with an nick!user@host mask of BigFoob!foobar@grape.slurpee.net sends
   you a message, IGNORE will use *!*foobar@*.slurpee.net to determine how
   to filter the message.  This will prove useful, as shown in the example
   below.

   Using IGNORE with no arguments displays the list of patterns you are
   ignoring or highlighting, as well as the type of messages for each
   pattern.

Options:
   ctcps      filter in/out all CTCPs received
   invites    filter in/out all INVITEs received
   msgs       filter in/out all MSGs received (but not CTCPs)
   notes      filter in/out all NOTEs received
   notices    filter in/out all NOTICEs received
   public     filter in/out public channel conversation
   wallops    filter in/out operator WALLOPS
   crap       anything else not listed above
   all        everything listed above
   none       remove pattern from list of filtered patterns

Examples:
   To ignore everything from foobar:
      /ignore foobar all

   To ignore everything except public conversation from foobar:
      /ignore foobar all -publics

   To highlight all private messages from foobar (it is displayed
   highlighted with whatever you have set HIGHLIGHT_CHAR to):
      /ignore foobar +msgs

   To ignore all NOTICEs except those from foobar's site:
      /ignore * notices
      /ignore *!*@*.slurpee.net ^notices

   To remove *!*foobar@*.slurpee.net from your ignore list:
      /ignore *!*foobar@*.slurpee.net none

   To highlight people joining and leaving, mode changes, etc. for a channel:
      /ignore #channel +crap

   rigmask(6); igtype(6); rigtype(6)

Restrictions:
   IGNORE is a client command.  All it does is hide messages sent to you by
   the person you want to ignore.  However, your server is actually still
   sending the messages to you, so while it works fine to ignore someone
   who is annoying you, it is not very effective when dealing with abusive
   users who insist on flooding you or the channel you're on.  On some
   servers, however, there is a mechanism to ignore a person at the server
   level, using a command called SILENCE.  SILENCE is limited to the
   Undernet, and servers derived from or compatible with it.

Other Notes:
   When removing a person from your ignorance list, you must specify the
   pattern to remove exactly as you originally entered it or as it appears
   in your ignorance list (case insensitive).  IGNORE does no pattern
   matching in this respect.
