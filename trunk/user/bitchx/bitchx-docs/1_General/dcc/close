Synopsis:
   dcc close <type> <nick> [<arguments>]

Description:
   DCC CLOSE closes an unwanted DCC connection, or cancels a pending one.
   The type, nickname, and parameters required are the same as those
   shown in DCC LIST output.  If no arguments are specified, the oldest
   DCC record for the given type and nick is closed.

   When DCC CLOSE is used on a pending incoming connection (one that has
   not yet been established), it is treated as a rejected connection, and
   a message to that effect is send back to the remote client.  Note that
   for an incoming SEND, the client actually records it as a GET, since
   from a local perspective, the client will be getting something from
   the remote client.
   
   DCC CLOSE can also accept the flag '-all' or an asterisk, '*', as either
   the type or the nickname.  This will work as a wildcard, closing all DCC's
   from that type or nickname.

Examples:
   To close an existing DCC CHAT connection with joebob:
      /dcc close chat joebob

   To reject an incoming DCC SEND connection from joebob:
      /dcc close get joebob

   To close all DCC CHAT connections:
      /dcc close chat *
         or
      /dcc close chat -all
