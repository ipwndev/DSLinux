Synopsis:
   dcc resume [=]<nick> <file>

Description:
   In the event that a DCC file transfer is interrupted, DCC RESUME can be
   used to continue it where the original transfer stopped.  This is
   generally most useful to users with very slow connections to the
   Internet transferring large files.

Examples:
   To restart a transfer with joebob:
      /dcc resume joebob somebigfile

See Also:
   dcc(1) close, get, send

Restrictions:
   This command is only available if the client was compiled with the
   BROKEN_MIRC_DCC_RESUME #define enabled (in the config.h).  The client
   compile options string (returned when $info(o) is evaluated) will have
   an 'i' in it if this option is enabled.

Other Notes:
   It is very important that the user realize that use of this feature is
   a blatant violation of the irc protocol (described in rfc 1459), in that
   it makes the client respond to a remote PRIVMSG with another PRIVMSG.
   While this may not mean much to the average user, it is nonetheless not
   "the right way" to do things, and irc operators have been known to KILL
   clients that violate the protocol in this manner.
