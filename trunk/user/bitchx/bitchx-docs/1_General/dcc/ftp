   DCC FTP initiates a ftp connection to a host. 

   To send a message across the DCC FTP connection, use MSG as you
   normally would, but prefix the hostname with a "-". If you have a ncftp
   bookmarks file in 2.x format, you can use shortcuts from that file for
   the hostname. If no user and password is specifed defaults are supplied
   for a anonymous connection.
