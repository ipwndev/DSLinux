   disconnect [<server number> [<reason>]]

Description:

   make the client quit.  If you are connected to multiple servers in
   multiple windows, the client will only close the connection to the
   current server.

Examples:
   To disconnect from your current server:
      /disconnect

   To disconnect from server 2 in your server list:
      /disconnect 2 I'll be back later!
