Synopsis:
   say <text>

Description:
   This command sends the specified text to the current channel.  It has
   numerous practical uses.  Among others, it allows the user to send a
   message to a channel even if CMDCHARS is for some reason not set,
   or is COMMAND_MODE is on.  It it also useful for allowing ALIASes,
   BINDs, scripts, and the like, to explicitly send a message to the
   current channel.

   Using the SAY command is functionally equivalent to using the
   command character with no command.  Of course, the default is to send
   text to the current channel if no command character is specified at
   all.

Examples:
   To send a message to the current channel:
      /say hello all!

   An alternate way to send a message:
      / hello all!

   To someone else on irc, your message will appear like this:
      <your_nick> hello all!

   To you, your message will appear like this:
      > hello all!

   msg(1); send(5); set(4) command_mode

Restrictions:
   SAY cannot send a message to any channel other than the current
   one.  You must switch channels with JOIN (or CHANNEL), or with
   whatever key is bound to SWITCH_CHANNELS.  Otherwise, use MSG to send
   the message to a specific destination.
