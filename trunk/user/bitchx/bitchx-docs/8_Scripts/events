Synopsis:
   load events

Description:
   This is another, though less thorough, example of the flexibility of
   EPIC's hook system.  It does the following:

   * the nickname of the last MSG sender is stored in $STATUS_USER
   * LIST, NAMES, and WHO output is more compact and less confusing
   * the client will print a message every hour on the hour
   * the NOTIFY command will show users' addresses for signons
