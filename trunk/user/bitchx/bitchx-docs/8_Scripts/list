Synopsis:
   load list

Description:
   This script is comprised of a single alias, /showlist.  It takes a list
   of words for arguments (any number is allowed), and prints them to the
   current window one at a time.

   This is evidently some sort of intellectual exercise, or proof of
   concept script.  It certainly isn't the best way to do what it does,
   but it does serve as a good example of how to run through an argument
   list without using recursion.
