Synopsis:
   load fake-dcc

Description:
   This script is mostly meant as example usage of the PRETEND command and
   the SEND_TO_SERVER hook.  This particular example shows how a DCC
   handshake can be modified to use a CTCP command word other than "DCC".
   It includes the function $getrandword(), which randomly returns a
   single word from a list of words.
