Synopsis:
   load complete

Description:
   This script was largely inspired by the T-shell (tcsh) and its flexible
   command-line tab completion.  The tab key (^I) can be used to expand
   partial nicknames, server names, or script files.  The expansion can be
   customized, permitting the user to expand just about anything to
   anything else.

   Adding New Expansions
     The interface allowing new expansions to be added is the /compl.add
     alias.  It takes a minimum of 2 (two) arguments; the commands to match
     for, and the matching method.  Basically, the syntax is:

       /compl.add -null|-nomatch|<command> <method>

     Any number of commands or switches may be specified.  The command must
     appear exactly as it would on the command line (including any command
     characters).  The "method" must be one of "messparse" (nickname
     expansion for MSG), "connparse" (server name expansion), or
     "loadparse" (script files).

   Showing Current Expansions
     A listing of all current tab expansion rules can be listed with the
     /compl.list alias.  Each expansion is assigned a unique index number,
     mainly for use in the /compl.del alias described below.

   Removing Expansions
     Tab expansion definitions can also be removed as desired.  This is
     done with the /compl.del alias. It takes a single argument, the index
     of the rule to delete (as shown with /compl.list).

   The script provides one additional alias, /makelist, which is used to
   gather the current list of servers on the network, for use in server
   name expansion.

Other Notes:
   This script relies on the COMPL.MODS script, and will not function
   without it.  It was written by Ian Frechette (Daemon).
