Synopsis:
   load finger

Description:
   This script provides a front-end to the Unix finger command.  Finger is
   a service that can provide general information about a user from another
   site, such as his/her real name, when the person last logged in, etc.
   The alias has the following syntax:

      /finger [[-h] <nickname>] [[user]@full.hostname]

   If a nickname is specified, the script will try to figure out the user's
   address, and will finger it.  It will finger @host if the -h switch is
   given.  Alternately, an address or hostname may be given, as per the
   traditional Unix finger syntax.

   This script was originally written by Ian Frechette (Daemon).  It has
   been revised for use with EPIC by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net.
