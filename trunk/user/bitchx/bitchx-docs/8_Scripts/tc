Synopsis:
   load tc

Description:
   This is another implementation of the classic tabscript.  It operates in
   essentially the same manner as tabkey; the differences between the two
   are in the coding itself, and are not really noticeable by the user.
   Externally, it is completely compatible with tabkey.

See Also:
   load(5); tabkey(8); tabkey.wc(8)

Other Notes:
   This script was written by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net.
