Synopsis:
   load edit

Description:
   This useful, but simple, script allows the user to edit any arbitrary
   loaded alias on the input line.  It creates a single alias, /edit,
   which takes one argument, an alias name.  Furthermore, the alias name
   may be abbreviated so long as it is not ambiguous.

Other Notes:
   This clever script was originally written by Charles Hannum (Mycroft),
   mycroft@prep.ai.mit.edu.  It has been heavily revamped and simplified
   by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net, to take advantages of EPIC
   features.
