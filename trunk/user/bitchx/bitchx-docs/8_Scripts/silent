Synopsis:
   load silent

Description:
   This script is meant for use in high-traffic channels.  It provides an
   alias, /silent, that suppresses the display of all join, part, signoff,
   topic, mode, and nick change messages.  They are instead displayed in
   the status bar in STATUS_USER (if present).  The normal behavior can be
   restored with /unsilent.

Other Notes:
   This script was originally written by Carl von Loesch (lynx).  It was
   modified for use with EPIC by persons unknown.
