Synopsis:
   load multi

Description:
   This script is meant to remove the need for the Multi program.  All it
   does is randomly switch characters of its input to upper or lowercase.
   The /varcase alias sends the output to the current channel or query,
   while /varcasemsg sends it in a MSG to someone.
