Synopsis:
   trace [<server>]

Description:
   This works something like the Unix traceroute utility.  It displays
   the route from the client's current server to a remote one.  It
   additionally will display any irc operators currently on the remote
   server, as well as any other servers connected to it.

   If no server is specified, the connections (operator, server) to the
   current server are displayed.  This is a convenient method of finding
   a local irc operator.

   TRACE can also be used to determine where a network bottleneck is if
   traffic to some users appears particularly slow.  If the output stops
   before completion, it can be assumed that the problem probably lies
   with the last server that replied to the trace, or the next one
   downstream.
