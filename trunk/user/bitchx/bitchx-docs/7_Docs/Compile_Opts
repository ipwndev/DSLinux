Compile-Time Options Available for BitchX                                

BitchX supports numerous configuration options that may be selectively 
included or excluded from the client at compile time.  Since many of these 
enable or disable certain special features, it is useful to script writers 
to be able to find out what options are present while the client is running.

The $info() function, used with the `O' command (`oh', not `zero'), will
return a text string that represents these options.  Each option is assigned
unique letter or number to identify it.  The options represented are most
of the #define options in the client's config.h file.  The default settings
would produce the following string:  2cefgnxz

This is a list of the #define options represented.  The letter designating
each option is listed, followed by its #define name, and whether it is
enabled or disabled by default in the config.h.
