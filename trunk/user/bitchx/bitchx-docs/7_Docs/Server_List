Server List Format in BitchX                                             

There are several ways to set a predefined list of servers for EPIC to use.
In general, though, they all use the same basic format:

   server:port:password:nickname

The server is the name of the server to connect to.  The port is the port
number on the server's host to connect on.  The password is only required
for servers that require one to connect.  The nickname is the nick to use
once connected to the server.  Only the server name is required.  The
remaining parameters may be specified as needed.  For example, to ignore
the password and nickname parameters:

   server:port

As parameters on the end are omitted, the colons separating them too are
omitted.  However, if a parameter in the "middle" is left out, but one that
comes after it is specified, the colons are required.  If you only wanted
to give a server and nickname:

   server:::nickname

A list of servers can exist in several forms.  The primary list is hardcoded
into the client.  It is usually overridden by a systemwide irc servers file
(usually called ircII.servers).  Any number of server definitions may be
specified, separated by whitespace (newline, space, tab).  A typical server
file might look like:

   irc.foobar.com
   irc.blah.net:6668
   irc.cia.gov:31337:cl00bie:Mr_Prez

The system server list may be overridden by your IRCSERVER environment
variable, which may contain a space-delimited list of servers:

   export IRCSERVER="irc.foobar.com irc.cia.gov:31337::Mr_Prez"

Finally, a list of servers may also be specified on the command line:

   irc Mr_Prez irc.foobar.com irc.cia.gov:31337:secret-password

As well a list of servers can be placed in the file ~/.ircservers which will
augment the IRCSERVER variable or the built-in list of servers.
