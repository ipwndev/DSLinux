Synopsis:
   die

Description:
   DIE causes the operator's server to do just that; die.  The process
   terminates normally.

Restrictions:
   This command is limited to irc operators.  Additionally, it may not be
   available even to them, depending on how the server was compiled.  The
   server must #define either OPER_DIE or LOCAL_DIE (or both) for someone
   to be able to use it at all.
