Synopsis:
   set input_prompt [<string>]

Description:
   This setting allows the user to add a custom string the the beginning
   of the input line (for display purposes).  Much like the various Unix
   shells, the prompt can contain any string desired.

   It is generally used for displaying information about the current
   target (such as a channel or queried nickname).  Any variables used in
   the prompt are re-evaluated after each command issued from the input
   prompt.
   
   Also note that any special highlight character (^B, ^C, etc) may be used
   in this setting.

   To disable the input prompt, unset the variable.
