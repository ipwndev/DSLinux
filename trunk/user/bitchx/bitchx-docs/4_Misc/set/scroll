Synopsis:
   set scroll [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will scroll text in a continuous, flowing
   fashion.  Old messages are progressively moved to the top of the
   screen (and off of it) as new text is added to the bottom.

   When turned off, the client will overwrite old text with new text,
   screen by screen.  This is primarily aimed at users with extremely
   dumb terminals (or terminal emulations) that cannot handle simple
   scrolling.  Typical behavior of such terminals includes repeated
   overwriting of the last line in the display, instead of scrolling
   the text upward.  It is also useful for users on extremely slow links
   (such as old 2400 bps modems), as it tends to be a bit quicker.
