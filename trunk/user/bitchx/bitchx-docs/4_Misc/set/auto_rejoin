Synopsis:
   set auto_rejoin [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this will cause the client to try to automatically
   rejoin any channel it is kicked out of.  It will correctly rejoin
   channels that have a channel key set, provided that key has not
   changed between the kick and the rejoin attempt.

   If turned off, the client behaves normally when kicked from a channel.

Other Notes:
   This setting should be turned off if the client has loaded a script
   that tries to handle automatic rejoins itself.
