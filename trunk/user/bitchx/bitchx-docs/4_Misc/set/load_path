Synopsis:
   set load_path [<directory>[:<directory> ...]]

Description:
   This setting is used primarily by LOAD and WHICH (and thus the $which()
   function).  If the client tries to access a file and cannot find it, it
   searches through each directory listed in the LOAD_PATH.  It operates
   much like the PATH statement in Unix shells.  The directories are
   searched sequentially.

Examples:
   To set the path to your home directory, and the client's script library:
      /set load_path ~:/usr/local/irc/script

   To add ~/my_irc to the path:
      /eval set load_path ${load_path}:~/my_irc

See Also:
   Environment_Vars(7); File_Ops(6); load(4); which(5)

Other Notes:
   The client will also obey the IRCPATH environment variable when first
   starting the client.  It will override LOAD_PATH until the client is
   started completely (i.e. everything in the .ircrc has loaded).
