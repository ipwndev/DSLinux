Synopsis:
   set novice [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   This is a security option.  When turned on, it prevents the user from
   interactively setting any hooks, and issues an automatic PART if the
   client is on a channel and a JOIN is issued (allowing the user to use
   only one channel at a time).

Other Notes:
   This setting does not prevent hooks from being set from within loaded
   files.  It only prevents them from being set (or viewed) from the
   input line.
