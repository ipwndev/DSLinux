Synopsis:
   set security [<number>]

Description:
   This variable allows the user to enable a number of security options,
   with the intent of preventing a rogue hook or loaded script from
   doing any potential damage.

   The setting is based on a set of bits, each of which can be enabled or
   disabled independently or in any combination.  Each bit has a specific
   value associated with it.  The bits are additive, much like the DEBUG
   setting.

       2     4     the SET command may only be used interactively

Examples:
   To disable EXEC and SET inside aliases or hooks:
      /set security 6

   To disable everything listed:
      /set security 7
