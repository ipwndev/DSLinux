Synopsis:
   set hold_mode [on|off|toggle]
 
Description:
   When turned on, this setting causes the client to pause the held window
   after each screenful of data, unless there is interaction by the user.
   If the user does not issue a command of some sort within one screenful,
   EPIC will buffer all further incoming messages.  An issued command or a
   simple carriage return will cause the display to advance another
   screenful, and so on, until the display is up to date again.

Other Notes:
   When using multiple ircII windows, the setting of HOLD_MODE does not
   change the current HOLD_MODE of any windows.  Rather, it refers to the
   default mode for any new windows.  The WINDOW HOLD_MODE command must
   be used to hold and unhold individual windows.
