Synopsis:
   set suppress_server_motd [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will attempt to hide the server's MOTD when
   connecting to the server.  When turned off, the MOTD will be displayed
   as normal upon connection to the server.  This setting only affects
   the initial connection.  It will always display the MOTD when it is
   requested with the MOTD command.

See Also:
   motd(2); on(5) 372, 374, 375

Other Notes:
   This setting works by filtering the 372, 374, and 375 server numerics.
   It is foiled by some servers, though, as recent versions (most notably,
   +CS variants) can be configured to send the MOTD with a different
   numeric, 377.
