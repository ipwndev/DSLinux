Synopsis:
   set status_format [<text>]

Description:
   This setting defines the appearance of the data in the status bar.  A
   great deal of information can be displayed in the status bar, such as
   the current time of day, the current channel name and its modes, the
   target of a query, and much more.

   The ever-changing data in the status bar is displayed with a series
   of special expandos.  Each expando has a particular purpose.  Keep in
   mind that these expandos are case-sensitive.

   All expandos are have a "map" level. The level can be specified by
   %{map}expando, where map is the map level and expando is the single
   character expando. The expandos specified above are in map level 0,
   which is assumed if no map level is specified. This means %{0}S means
   the same thing as %S.

   Note that STATUS_USER - STATUS_USER3 have 2 (two) expandos associated
   with them.  This is for convenience, as the remaining user-definable
   expandos are only referenced by number.  The duplicates cannot be set
   independently. The STATUS_USER expandos defined in the map level
   of their respective tens-digit. This is especially important for those
   above 9, which *must* have their map level specified.  For example,
   STATUS_USER15 would be specified as %{1}5.

   The expandos marked by asterisks (*) are only displayed when certain
   conditions are met.  Refer to their respective help files for further
   information.  The %D expando has no help file; it is present only when
   the client is transferring a file over DCC.  It displays the file being
   sent, and shows how much has been sent.

   The expandos marked by a plus (+) can also be expanded within their
   associated variable independently of the status bar.  This means that
   including a literal %expando in the variable will expand its contents
   before it is placed in the status bar, instead of displaying the literal
   text "%expando".

   The normal behavior is to cause the last character in the status bar to
   repeat until the the of the line.  This can be disabled by turning on
   the STATUS_NO_REPEAT setting, or by making the last character in
   STATUS_FORMAT a space.  No repetition is done if the right-alignment
   expando is used.

   If the current window happens to have DOUBLE turned on (double status
   line), then this setting is ignored, in favor of STATUS_USER1 and
   STATUS_USER2.  The former applies to the top line, the latter to the
   bottom.  They are otherwise the same as STATUS_FORMAT.

Examples:
   A common status bar configuration:
      /set status_format *%R* %H%=%@%N%*%S%# %C%+%Q %O%M%A%T%W %D *

   A common doubled status bar configuration:
      /set status_format1 *%R* %H%=%@%N%*%S%# %C%+%Q %O%M%A%T %D *
      /set status_format2 %W %X %Y $Z *
