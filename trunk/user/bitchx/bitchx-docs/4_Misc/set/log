Synopsis:
   set log [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   This variable globally sets whether the client saves its lastlog buffer
   to an external file.  The actual buffer itself isn't saved, rather
   anything that is saved to the buffer is also saved to the file.

   If multiple windows are in use, this setting will affect all of them,
   and will make no distinction in the log file as to which messages are
   from which window.  In this case, WINDOW LOG should be used.
