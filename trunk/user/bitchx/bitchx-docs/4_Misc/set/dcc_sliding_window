Synopsis:
   set dcc_sliding_window [<number>]

Description:
   This implements a simplified version of the traditional sliding window
   algorithm for DCC SENDs.  The client keeps <size> packets ready to
   send at all times, which can speed up DCC file transfers a great deal
   over slow network connections.  No special support is required by the
   receiving client.

   The size is measured in 2k blocks, and is set by default at 2 (4k).
   No error correction is even attemted by the client, rather it relies
   completely on TCP to keep things straight. The feature can effectively be
   disabled by setting it to 1.
