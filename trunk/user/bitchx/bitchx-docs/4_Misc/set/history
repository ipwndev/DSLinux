Synopsis:
   set history [<number>]

Description:
   This setting controls the number of commands to be stored in the
   client's internal history buffer.  Setting it to 0 (zero) effectively
   disables command history.  However, the client will continue to save
   commands to an external file unless HISTORY_FILE is disabled as well.

   A command is inserted into the history buffer when it is executed, or
   when the SHOVE_TO_HISTORY key function is used.  The history buffer
   is not purged when HISTORY is disabled.
