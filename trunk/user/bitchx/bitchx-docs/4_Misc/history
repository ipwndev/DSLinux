Synopsis:
   history [<number>]
   ! [<history number|history match>]

Description:
   Command history is a useful little feature that allows you to
   quickly recall commands previously executed.  The conventions
   followed are similar to those of the GNU bash or Cornell's tcsh Unix
   command shells.  There are two versions of this command, one which
   just lists out the command history, and another which actually
   recalls a specific command for use on the input line.

   The HISTORY command is the simple version.  All it does is spit out
   a list of commands you've previously entered (the exact number is
   determined by your HISTORY setting).  You can limit the number of
   items to list, or just list all of them.  Each item is assigned a
   unique index number, which can be referred to by !.  This list can
   be saved for later use, if you have HISTORY_FILE set to something.

   The more complex version is the ! command.  Based on the input you
   give it, it searches through your command history list and finds the
   first item that matches your query and puts it on the input line for
   immediate use.  You can search based on a partial string (such as a
   command name, so search for the last use of it), or an index number.

Examples:
   To list the 50 most recent items in your command history:
      /history 50

   To find the most recent use of the MSG command:
      /!/msg

   To use item 37 in your command history:
      /!37
