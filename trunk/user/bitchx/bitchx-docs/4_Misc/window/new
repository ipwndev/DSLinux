Synopsis:
   window new

Description:
   This creates a new ircII window.  This splits in half (vertically) either
   current window, or the largest.  This differs from WINDOW CREATE in that
   the client need not be running in any special environment to utilize it.
   By default, the new window will be created with the NOTIFY_LEVEL and
   HOLD_MODE settings.
