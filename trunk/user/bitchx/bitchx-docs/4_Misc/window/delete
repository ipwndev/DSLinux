Synopsis:
   window delete

Description:
   This does the opposite of WINDOW CREATE, it destroys the current screen
   or xterm, depending on the environment.  The main window (the one ircII-
   EPIC was started in) cannot be deleted.

   Of course, if the client is not running under screen or X, this command
   has no effect.  Also, any channels in the window being deleted are not
   left, though if the window is on a separate server, the connection is
   severed.
