Synopsis:
   window next

Description:
   This sets the current window to the next numbered window.  Windows are
   numbers sequentially, so if the current window is 2, this command will
   set window 3 as the current.  If the window happens to be the last in
   the list, the first becomes the current.  If the next window is hidden,
   it becomes the current window by swapping itself with the old current
   window.
