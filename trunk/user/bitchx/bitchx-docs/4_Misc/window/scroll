Synopsis:
   window scroll on|off|toggle

Description:
   This control the scroll mode of the current window.  If it is off, the
   window scrolls normally.  If it is on, the window will pause after a
   windowful of text has been displayed with no interaction from the
   user; pressing the return key will resume scrolling (which may stop
   again if the scroll buffer has more lines than can be displayed in the
   window).

   The scroll mode of new windows defaults to the current setting of
   HOLD_MODE.

   set(4) hold_mode

Other Notes:
   This command is fairly obsolete.  The equivalent SET command performs
   the same action.  This command will still work, of course, but the
   client will inform the user that it has been deprecated.
