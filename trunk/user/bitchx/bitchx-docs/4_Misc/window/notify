Synopsis:
   window notify

Description:
   This turns on notification for the current window.  This means that,
   should the current window ever be hidden, a message will be displayed
   in the new current window indicating activity in hidden window.

   The notification can be limited to certain types of messages; see
   WINDOW NOTIFY_LEVEL.  Contrary to the name, this command has nothing
   to do with the NOTIFY command.
