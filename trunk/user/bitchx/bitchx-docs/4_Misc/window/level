Synopsis:
   window level [<levels>]

Description:
   This sets what type of messages are displayed in the current window.
   The actual levels to display may consist of a comma-delimited list
   of valid levels (see SET LASTLOG_LEVEL for a complete description).
   If no level is specified, the current is displayed.

   For windows that only display certain types of information, the rest
   is not actually discarded.  Rather, it will go to a window that is
   set to display such information, or lacking that, the current window.
   To actually hide information from the screen, see the ON command.

Examples:
   To make the current window display only public and misc. messages:
      /window level public,crap

Other Notes:
   By default, all windows start out with a LEVEL of ALL.  However, if the
   PHONE #define was enabled (in config.h) at compile time, this default
   is NONE.  The string returned by evaluating $info(o) will contain a 'p'
   if PHONE was enabled.
