Synopsis:
   bind <key> self_insert

Description:
   This function overrides the key's default value, causing it to insert
   itself into the input buffer, instead of doing what it would normally
   do.  This can be used to intentionally prevent certain control keys
   from being misused.

   This function has a similar effect on the specified key as the
   QUOTE_CHARACTER function does on the key it precedes.
