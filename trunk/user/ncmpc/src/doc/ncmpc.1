.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ncmpc is  a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. 
ncmpc connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local 
network.

By default, ncmpc connects to localhost:6600. 
This can be changed either at compile\-time, or by exporting the 
MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables, or by the command line
options \-\-host and \-\-port.

$ ncmpc \-\-host=musicserver \-\-port=44000

To use a password with mpd, set MPD_HOST to password@host 
or use the command line option \-\-password. Values from 
the command line overrides values from the environment.

Some  useful examples for format are: 

   "%file%" 

and 

   "[[%artist% \- ]%title%]|[%file]" 
.SH "BUGS"

.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, ncmpc needs to convert characters to the 
charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors when your running ncmpc you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting any of the LC_CTYPE, LANG or LC_ALL enviroment variables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).

mpc(1), mpd(1), locale(5), locale(7)
