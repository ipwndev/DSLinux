# the user wants to configure in `.', just like we don't know whether
# the `make' program is called `make'.  I'm keeping them for the sake
# of the users who expect to find them.  I don't want to make this
# file complicated by implementing smarter detections -- the user who
# needs different behavior should simply run `make -f Makefile.cvs'
# and proceed as he would have normally.
