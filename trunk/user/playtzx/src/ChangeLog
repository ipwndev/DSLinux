	* Removed arbitrary limit of 2048 blocks, which would previously
	  cause a buffer overflow (eg with Summit Software's 'Rescue From
	  Atlantis', Side A).

	* Didn't fix all the rest of the potential buffer overflows.

	* Didn't update the documentation other than this ChangeLog and
	  a little piece at the top of README.

	* Released version 0.12c.
