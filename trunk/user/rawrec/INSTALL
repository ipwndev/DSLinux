This is a late beta release, though it seems to work correctly for me.

To install:

1. Change directory to the src directory:
 
     cd src

2. As root, make the executables:

     make

3. The man page currently resides in the docs/user directory.  To view
   it before installing it, make sure you are in that directory and do
    
     man ./rawrec.1

4. If you want to install rawrec/rawplay in a standard location, edit
   the Makefile and set EXE_DIR and MAN_DIR as desired (defaults are
   /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1 respectively).  These
   directories will be created if they don't already exist when you
   do:

     make install

   to install the binary and documentation.  Of course, EXE_DIR must
   be in your path and MAN_DIR in your man path for you to be able to
   run the executable and view the documentation in the normal way.
