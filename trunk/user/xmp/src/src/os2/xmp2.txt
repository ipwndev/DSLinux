		XMP - eXtended Module Player (OS/2 Port)

This is a port of the eXtended Module Player to OS/2. 

Requirements:

	1. OS/2 Warp 3 (FP17 and up)
	   OS/2 Warp 4
	   OS/2 WSeB

	2. Sound Card with DART drivers

	3. EMX Runtime (exmrt.zip from hobbes)

	4. Module Files (http://www.scene.org)

See the XMP Home Page @ http://xmp.sourceforge.net/

Notes:
	1. When using the -b 8 or --bits 8 option
	   insure that you also use the -u option
	   or the output will sound REALLY bad!!
	
	2. Look at the xmp.conf file for 
	   configuration options.

	3. The configuration files (xmp.conf & 
	   xmp-modules.conf) can be located in
	   the HOME path as described in the 
	   headers of the files OR in the current
	   drive and directory. The /etc directory
	   is NOT used as the headers claim!

	4. I think Have have eliminated all the 
	   bugs causing XMP to crash on SOME types
	   of files but still it's always wise
	   to be prepared for a crash when using
	   XMP.

	5. Corrupt files may cause XMP2 to 
	   generate a trap.	

	6. I give no guarantees that the software
	   will work. Use this software at your
	   own risk. Plus all the other standard 
	   disclaimers :)
