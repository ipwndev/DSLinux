Century Software PIXIL Operating Environment README
v1.2.3 September 10, 2003

**** DESCRIPTION ****

PIXIL is a small footprint operating environment, complete with
PDA PIM applications, a browser and multimedia applications
for small handheld and flat-panel based devices.

The PIXIL Operating Environment and Applications were initially
designed to work within the Microwindows graphical windowing
environment, for an extremely small footprint.  The Microwindows
environment can be setup to run directly on framebuffer, or, for 
demonstration, on top of the X11 desktop environment, for people
without a working framebuffer system.

For instructions for building and installing PIXIL using Microwindows,
see docs/README.microwindows.

The PIXIL open source site is http://www.pixil.org
The Century Software embedded site is http://embedded.censoft.com

**** LICENSE ****

PIXIL is dual-licensed under the GPL license (see docs/LICENSE.GPL),
as well as Century Software's commercial CCL license (see docs/LICENSE.DUAL).
If your application is open source and fully GPL, then you are
able to use PIXIL under the GPL-only license.  Otherwise, a more commercial
oriented license is available from Century Software, Inc. (embedded.censoft.com)
See http://www.pixil.org/license.html or
email cetsales@centurysoftware.com for more information.

**** REQUIREMENTS ****

http://www.microwindows.org	Microwindows 0.90 or greater
http://www.w3.org		w3c-libwww 5.2.8 or greater (for ViewML)
http://www.fltk.org		FLTK 1.0.11 (for PIXIL Desktop)

You will need w3c-libwww if you want to build the ViewML browser.
Grab the libraries here: http://www.w3.org/Library/ (if you are building
on RedHat, you probably already have them installed).

Indicate where your libraries are installed when configuring with menuconfig.

**** CONFIGURING ****

PIXIL is configured by editing the configuration file 'config'.
You may use the configuration system to ensure that your system is
set up correctly.  You can either use 'make menuconfig' or
'make oldconfig' to select your desired options.

To use menuconfig, at the prompt type 'make menuconfig'.  This will provide
you with a curses based menu.  Curses won't run on some systems, for that
you can use 'make oldconfig' which provides a text version of the same 
configuration engine.
 
One last thing, make double sure your paths are correct, otherwise 
your build won't get very far.  See docs/README.microwindows for
more information.

For cross-compiling information for the ARM processor, see
docs/README.ARM.

**** BUILDING ****

After insuring the that library locations and install locations
are set properly in the config file, type 'make'.

**** INSTALLING ****

Type 'make install' at the prompt, and the PIXIL binaries and libraries 
will be copied to the specified installation directory, which defaults
to /usr/local/pixil.

**** RUNNING ****

Change directory to the installation directory, usually /usr/local/pixil.
Typing ./run_pda.sh will start the Microwindows Nano-X server, and
the PIXIL Operating Environment.  If you are running Microwindows
on top of X11, and have built the PIXIL Desktop, you may also run
./run_desktop.sh to start PIXIL Desktop (see docs/README.pixilDT for
more information).
