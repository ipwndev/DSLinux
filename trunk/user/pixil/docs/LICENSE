The files comprising the PIXIL Operating Environment fall under
three license categories, dependent upon the original origin of
the software component.  These three categories and license
documents are:

LICENSE.DUAL: Dual-licensed GPL and Century Commercial License (CCL).
LICENSE.GPL:  GPL only (GPL)
LICENSE.LGPL: LGPL only (LGPL)

See the above named files for descriptions of these licenses.

PIXIL is dual-licensed under the GPL license (see docs/LICENSE.GPL),

able to use PIXIL under the GPL-only license.  Otherwise, a more commercial
oriented license is available from Century Software, Inc.
