- Does not always show correct colors (See Microsoft Window Sytle).
  Note: It does call for the correct color "numbers", it just doesn't
  show them on the screen correctly.

- Find and fix any memory leaks.
- Add 2 byte character support.
- Make sure XPM's do not crash under framebuffer mode.
- Nano-X window managers do not handle resizing from child windows
  (hence the resizeborder and the fullscreen demos cannot work correctly).
- The Nano-X X11 mouse driver does not always catch mouse release events.
  For example, if you wildly drag up and down on scroll bars, the
  FL_RELEASE is never sent. Therefore the FL_DRAG holds indefinitely untill
  your next mouse click.
- Obtain bitmaps for all FLTK supported cursors.
- Make sure the colors for all FLTK supported cursors change to the correct
  foreground and background colors. Sometimes you'll want the bitmap to be
  the foreground and other times the mask.
