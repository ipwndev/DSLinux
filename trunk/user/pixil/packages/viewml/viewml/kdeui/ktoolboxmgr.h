 /**
  * KToolBoxManager is a class for self management of small windows.
  * Windows can be resized or moved. During move/resize it will emit
  * all changes and you can recompute and accept or discard new geometry.
  * You can define hot spots on the screen, and you will receive signal
  * when your widget enters it. KToolBoxManager doesn't draw any decoration.
  *
  * You will call (after constructing KToolBoxManager instance) doMove or
  * doResize when mouse presses some handle point of your widget. Then,
  * KToolBoxManager will move (or resize) hollow rectangle (or actual widget)
  * on the screen. Moving/resizing is finished on mouse release event or
  * by calling stop() function.
  * Provided that your widget is top-level, the simplest use is like this:
  * <pre>
  * mousePressevent(QMouseEvent *)
  * {
  *  KToolBoxManager *mgr = new KToolBoxManager(this);
  *  doMove();
  * }
  * </pre>
  * Moving/resizing can be transparent or opaque. In transparent mode, word
  * "resizer" refers to hollow rectangle which is actually resized or moved.
  * In opaque mode it refers to actual widget.
  *
  * Moving child widgets in opaque mode will move the widget only inside your
  * parent widget. You can drag it outside, but you won't see it, neither
  * during drag nor after. You should reparent it in that case.
  *
  * Functions doMove and doResize do not return untill mouse is released or
  * stop() function is called. However, this is QTimer driven so you will
  * receive signals, and Qt-engine will operate normally. Halting does not
  * hog CPU (it's not an empty for(;;) loop).
  *
  * You will not receive mouseRelease event when mouse is released. (uh.)
  *
  * @short Class for own window management.
