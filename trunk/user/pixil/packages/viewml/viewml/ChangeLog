Removed all warnings, etc. during compilation. -Wall added to
  viewml/makeinclude to catch this in the future
Added Chris Hawk's patches for qregexp (to fix reference URLs)
  and for html.cpp to fix the BIG tag (made it +1 instead of ..
  what .. 0?)
Fixed all Redhat 7.1 compilation problems (gcc 2.96)
Redid qarray to not use the STL vector class

April 11, 2001 (Ouch! Long time between updates!)
====================================
A patch provided by Chris Hawks <chrish@syscon-intl.com> to 
  make the argument parsing much more unix-y and allow a url
  to be passed without the -u flag (though for
  backward-combatibility, it still works.)
Another patch provided by Chris Hawks <chrish@syscon-intl.com> 
  providing the following enhacements:
  1. Drop-down lists now show the default choice.
  2. Radio buttons now look good (using round, instead of diamonds.)
  3. Some standard colors added. 
  4. Removed lots of debug cerrs/couts (Thanks!!)
  5. Listboxes now implemented.
  6. Using requested font families and colors for buttons, combos,
     and listboxes.
  7. And probably more that I missed when patching the code.
An addition to keep a reference-counted pixmaps. This was 
  necessary to allow the proper cleanup of tmp files and freeing
  of images (which wasn't happening in all cases.) This greatly
  helps stability.
A fix to qstring in the findRev method that was causing invalid
  URL parsing in some cases.
Many fixes to the HTTP classes that make everything much more stable.
  Basically, everything is now cleaned up properly when a new page is
  loaded, even if the previous page hadn't finished. Also, some protection
  is added for pending HTTP GETs performing callbacks to HTMLViews which
  no longer exist.
QColor was fixed to provide default color initialization.
Addition of a atexit handler that properly cleans up the all the
  objects in the event of a violent Microwindows termination (there
  is an exit() in the client code if it ever gets a read error.)
Added support for a proxy server through an environment variable,
  VIEWML_PROXY. This should be set as follows for a proxy server:
  export VIEWML_PROXY=http://www-proxy.foo.com:8080 
  Of course you should use your own proxy server :-)

November 15th, 2000
====================================
Got rid of the consts, pixmaps, and other general
  garbage cluttering up viewml/src/main.cpp. I
  added viewml/src/vmlapp.cpp, viewml/src/vmlapp.h,
  viewml/src/pixmaps.h and viewml/src/fltk/qconsts.h
Fixed support for the X version of FLTK. This hadn't been
  working properly when the new widget re-org happened.
Added a new VMLApp class that does some special event
  handling. FLTK doesn't pass FL_RELEASE events through
  to children for some reason. I added the same code to
  qwidget.cpp for the same reason.
You'll need the newest version of FLNX to make everything
  work properly with this version under Microwindows. Until
  this is released, just check it out from CVS.
Tabs will now take you between widgets in forms.

November 14th, 2000
====================================
Finished scrollbar support. This now comes from the
  KHTMLView class instead of the main UI.
Implemented buttons, combo-boxes, scrollbars,
  radio buttons, single and multi-line edits. Some
  callbacks are not happening.
Forms are working partially. GETs now do the right
  thing, but POSTs don't function (something in the 
  w3c-www lib)
Massive reorg in the way form widgets are handled. I got
  rid of the multiple inheritence and replaced it with
  contained widgets in a parent window that doesn't draw.
Fixed a bunch of signal handling problems:
  1. Whitespace is now stripped from slot/signal names.
  2. initMetaObject is now called automatically when
     performing a connect with a given object.
  3. Given the above, I got rid of the hacks in the
     KDE objects where I called initMetaObject directly.
Added Fl_Window_Resize which is a new FLNX class that
  gives an application notice that the window was resized.
  This helps when running under a window manager under
  Microwindows where it moves and sometimes tries to 
  resize your windows.
All the windows/widgets/scrollbars are now double buffered.
  This helps when drawing as everything is now flicker-free!

November 2nd, 2000
====================================
Added temporary scrollbar support to the main UI.
Many, many bugfixes in the hierarchy of the classes.
  Basically, a lot of the multiple inheritance has been
  removed to permit better organization. 
Most of the segfaults have been fixed. It now seems to
  be really stable.
Tons of bugs were fixed with the Microwindows version of
  ViewML, most of which were actually changes in FLNX.
Forward, Back, and reload buttons now work. We keep 
  proper track of the history now.
You can now change the size of the window with the
  constants at the top of main.cpp. Resize support will
  be added when this is fixed in FLNX.
Changed the derivation of QWidget, QPaintDevice to be
  actual FL_Window so children work.
Images for the buttons now work under Microwindows.

Finished Tasks as of Tuesday, August 22nd
====================================
Added small history function to the interface (hit the
  space bar to cycle through the history list.) This
  helps greatly when debugging (less typing.)
Font metrics with Microwindows now works properly.
  However, font selection is still not working properly
  under FLTK with Microwindows.
Fixed misc. seg faults when dealing with multiple timers.
  This seems to make the thing pretty stable.
Finished implmentation of the background timers that control
  the updating of the page when images are loaded. It now
  draws everything properly.
src/fltk/qpixmap.cpp now works with images under Microwindows.
Full URL handling seems to be working.

Finished Tasks as of Tuesday, August 1st
====================================
Removed libwww acess from main UI thread, shoving it into
  the background with the other network access. This will
  fix some misc. SEGFAULTS as well.
Made the first port to Microwindows (Nano-X). This only works
  with the upcoming 0.88 final release (coming soon) with 
  FLTK (flnx)
Better handling for relative URLS (still needs some work)
Background colors for table cells now working properly
Don't have to type "http://" in front of URLS (it is assumed)
Clicking on Links now works.
Even better font matching.
Much improved memory usage (including fixing of all the
  auto-deletion stuff for the collection classes.)
	
Finished Tasks as of Monday, July 25th
====================================
Resizing now works properly. You can drag the corner of the window
  and the contents will do the right thing.
Fonts now look correct. All the italics, bold, and most font
families are supported. Some more minor font updates will be coming
later this week, but for the most part, it is looking good.
Images now function (try www.slashdot.com). There is some problem
with relative URL's not being handled correctly that should be fixed
by later on today.
Lots of little code cleanups.

Finished Tasks as of Monday, July 17th
====================================
Finish re-implementation of Qt signals
Re-write URL handling
Initial redraw bug (Grrrrr)

Fixed color implementation. Still needs some work for default colors
of table cells.
All network access was moved to using libwww.
