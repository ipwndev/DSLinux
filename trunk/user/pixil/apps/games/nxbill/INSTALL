To install:
	edit Imakefile
	xmkmf -a
	make
	If you have root access:
		1) make install
		1) make installman
	If not:
		1) make -k install (and ignore the error)
		2) copy 'xbill' to somewhere in your path.
		2) copy xbill.man to somewhere in your manpath.

Notes:
 - libXpm is required.  If you don't have it, get it from any X ftp site.

 - If you're using GCC, you need 2.6.x or newer.  If not, I have no idea
   how current of a C++ compiler you need.

 - The game looks a bit better when compiled with Motif widgets, but may be
   easier to compile with Athena widgets.  In Imakefile, select one of these.

 - In Imakefile, select whether to install the images in a standard place or
   your home directory.

 - The game doesn't run too well over a slow network.  Sorry.
