        Sun clock

        Designed and implemented by John Walker in November of 1988.

        Version for the Sun Workstation.

    The algorithm used to calculate the position of the Sun is given in
    Chapter 18 of:

    "Astronomical  Formulae for Calculators" by Jean Meeus, Third Edition,
    Richmond: Willmann-Bell, 1985.  This book can be obtained from:
