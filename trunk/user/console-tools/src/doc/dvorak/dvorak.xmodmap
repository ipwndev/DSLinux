! This file should be given as an argument to xmodmap to
! switch from a qwerty to a Dvorak keyboard.
!
! If you want to be easily able to switch the keyboard
! back to its previous state, first run xmodmap -pke and
! redirect the output to a file.  Then you can switch back
! by giving that file as an argument to xmodmap.  For
! example, if you type:
!
!     xmodmap -pke > /tmp/keyboard.default
!
! before switching the keyboard, you can then type:
!
!     xmodmap /tmp/keyboard.default
!
! to reset the keyboard to its previous state.
!
! Note that if you pass this file again as an argument to
! xmodmap, you will apply these translations a second time
! and come out with gibberish!

! The keysyms for the top row have been moved to the end
! of the file (and translations that would normally have
! no effect are still included) because of conflicts with
! some of the extended keysyms on HP workstations.  If the
! keysyms for the 8 and 9 keys are not defined explicitly
! *after* the keysyms for bracketleft and bracketright,
! they end up getting bound to "slash question" and "equal
! plus", respectively.
