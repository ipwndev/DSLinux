TRACE %|[<server>|<nick>]

Without a specified server TRACE shows the current connections on the local server.  If you specify a remote server it will show all servers between your current server and that remote server as well as the connections on that remote server. With a nick it shows the servers in between and information about that nick.

On some servers, TRACE shows information such as IP addresses and idle times.
