/DCC LIST
    - Shows all the open DCC connections.
/DCC RESUME [<nick> [<file>]]
    - Resumes a DCC SEND/GET connection.
/DCC CHAT [-passive] [<nick>]
    - Sends a chat connection request to remote client or accepts 
      a chat connection if the remote end has already sent a request.
      If -passive is used then the passive DCC protocol is used (as mIRC
      can do). This is useful to bypass a NAT/firewall which limit your
      possibility in listening for remote connections.
/DCC GET [<nick> [<file>]]
    - Gets the file offered by remote client. The file is downloaded and
      saved into the current working directory.
/DCC SEND [-passive] [-append | -prepend | -flush | -rmtail | -rmhead]
          <nick> <file> [<file> ...]
    - Sends a DCC SEND request to remote client. Remote end has to accept
      the request before the transmission can be started. Giving multiple
      files queues them. File names may contain shell expansion
      characters: * ? [] ~ (~ expansion may not be supported on all
      platforms). Files with spaces in their names need to be quoted (eg.
      "file name"). If -passive is used then the passive DCC protocol is
      used (as mIRC and xchat > 2.0.7 can do). This is useful to bypass a
      NAT/firewall which limit your possibility in  listening for remote
      connections.
/DCC SERVER [<+|-scf> <port>]
    - Starts a DCC SERVER on the specified port. The remote can connect
      to this server and initiate chat, send and fserve requests. You can
      specify + or - using any combination of the flags 's' (Send),
      'c' (Chat), or 'f' (Fserver).
/DCC CLOSE <type> <nick> [<file>]
    - Closes a DCC-connection. Type can be either SEND, GET or CHAT.
