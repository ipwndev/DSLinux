-------------------------------
cNibbles is a curses based version of the old nibbles game (also known as 
snake). Your object is to control the worm and help it eat apples 
distributed on the playing area. 

Use the arrow keys (h,j,k,l alternatively) to move the worm. The m and z 
keys can be used for relative movement. The q key quits the game and the p 
key pauses the game.
