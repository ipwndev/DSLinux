 * NOTES -- PC version
 *
 * A sprite consists in 4 columns and 0x15 rows of (U16 mask, U16 pict),
 * each pair representing 8 pixels (cga encoding, two bits per pixels).
 * Sprites are stored in 'sprites.bin' and are loaded by spr_init. Memory
 * is freed by spr_shutdown.
 *
 * There are four sprites planes. Plane 0 is the raw content of 'sprites.bin',
 * and planes 1, 2 and 3 contain copies of plane 0 with all sprites shifted
 * 2, 4 and 6 pixels to the right.
