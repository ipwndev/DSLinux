This file specifies the differences between the Linux and Windows versions of Noiz2sa.

Installation:
Download the data files, and the executable for your platform. Put noiz2sa in this directory.
On most systems, simply open a console, switch to root, and run ./install.sh. If that doesn't work, you can install manually. Copy noiz2sa_share/* to /usr/share/games/noiz2sa, noiz2sa to /usr/bin and make sure everything works.

Running:
Type noiz2sa to start the game. The command-line line switches listed in readme_e.txt should all work.

Compiling:
Install the OpenGL development libraries. (This is the hard part.)
Install libBulletML. (http://user.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~s31552/wp/libbulletml/index_en.html Compiling should be simple. Copy the resulting .a file to /usr/lib)
Install SDL_mixer.
Compile with "make -f makefile.lin"
The file "noiz2sa" goes in your path, and all directories except src go in /usr/share/games/noiz2sa. (Or use the install script.) src is unneeded after compiling.

Uninstall:
Remove the directory /usr/share/games/noiz2sa, the file /usr/bin/noiz2sa and the file ~/.noiz2sa.prf.
