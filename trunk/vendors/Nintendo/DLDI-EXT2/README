This is an experimental build that requires you to partition your media card:
First partition (/dev/dldi1) - Whatever filesystem your SC/M3/Whatever firmware can handle

Second partition (/dev/dldi2) - ext2

Use fakeroot to build as I haven't worked out why mknod hasn't got the right permissions.
Once built, copy images/dslinux.nds to /dev/dldi1 and extract AS ROOT images/dslinux-ext2-data.tgz to /dev/dldi2.

To shutdown, use the provided /etc/rc.d/shutdown to avoid filesystem damage
