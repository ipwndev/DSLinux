#	INSTRUCTIONS
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is read-only!
# You have to make a copy of this file so you can edit it.
#
# If you are using the DLDI build,
# run this command to create the copy:
#	cp /etc/rc.defaults /media/linux/etc/rc.conf
#
# If you are using the GBAMP or the GBAMP-EXT2 build,
# run this command to create the copy:
#	cp /etc/rc.defaults /gbamp/linux/etc/rc.conf
#
# If you are using the DSMEM build,
# run this command to create the copy:
#	cp /etc/rc.defaults /sd/linux/etc/rc.conf
#
# If you are using the NDS version of DSLinux,
# run this command to create the copy:
#	cp /etc/rc.defaults /var/rc.conf
# NOTE THAT /var/rc.conf WILL NOT BE PRESERVED ACROSS
# REBOOTS ON THE NDS BUILD!
#
# If you are using the DSGBA version of DSLinux,
# run this command to create the copy:
#	cp /etc/rc.defaults /sram/rc.conf.
# The /sram filesystem needs to be initialised before
# it can be used.
# See http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Running_DSLinux
# for more information.
#
# Then edit the copy with vi.
# If you have never used vi before, see:
# 	http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Vi
# There is an introduction to vi on that page.

# This file provides default flags for the DSLinux boot process.
# The flags defined in this file can be either set or empty.
# If a flag is empty, it will not affect the system.

# This sets the hostname. You can set this to whatever you want.
hostname="NintendoDS"

# By default, wireless networking is not started on boot.
# If you want to enable it at boot time, set this flag to "YES".
# Note that before you enable this you should configure wireless
# networking. You can either do so further below in this file
# or use the 'wnc' program to configure wireless automatically.
enable_network_on_boot="NO"

# You can start networking anytime by running:
#	/etc/rc.d/network start
# and stop it anytime by running:
#	/etc/rc.d/network stop

# DSLinux can use network settings from your Nintendo WiFi
# Connection (WFC) profiles. If you want to use this feature,
# set wfc_config to the number of the profile you want to use,
# either 1, 2 or 3. You don't have to configure anything else
# if you use WFC settings.
# If you don't want to use WFC settings, leave wfc_config
# empty and configure your network below instead.
wfc_config=""

# Set the essid of your wireless router here.
# For example:
# 	essid="MyEssid"
# You cannot use wireless networking without setting an essid.
# Note that DSLinux only works in managed mode, i.e. with
# an access point. Ad-hoc mode is not supported.
essid=""

# If DSLinux fails to associate with your access point,
# try setting you access point's channel here.
# For example:
#	channel="11"
channel=""

# Here you can set a wepkey. Both 64bit and 128bit keys are
# supported. For hex keys, just enter the key without prefix:
#	wepkey="9923829ea8923"
# For ascii keys, make sure you use an 's:' prefix:
# 	wepkey="s:mysecretkey"
# If you do not want to use WEP, just leave this flag empty.
wepkey=""

# You can assign a static IP and gateway. If you leave IP
# empty, automatic configuration via DHCP is used instead.
#
# For example:
#	ip="192.168.1.42"
#	gateway="192.168.1.1"
ip=""
gateway=""

# If you are not using DHCP, you can supply a
# netmask and a broadcast address, if you want to.
netmask=""
broadcast=""

# You can specify up to 2 DNS servers if you don't use DHCP.
dns1=""
dns2=""

# If you want to start inetd on boot, say "YES" here
# Don't forget to edit /etc/inetd.conf!
start_inetd="NO"

# To start openvpn on boot say "YES" here
# Please read /etc/openvpn.conf.example
start_openvpn="NO"

# If you want to see your DS firmware version on boot,
# set this to "YES". By default, the firmware version is shown.
show_firmware_version="YES"

# If you want to start nanoX at boot, set this to "YES".
# Note that nanoX is not really useful at this point.
start_nanox="NO"

# If you want to start PIXIL at boot, set this to "YES".
start_pixil="NO"

# To start the boa webserver on boot, set this to "YES"
# NOTE: The default website is /var/www
start_boa="NO"

# To start the inadyn DynDns.org client, set to "YES"
# NOTE: Please edit /etc/inadyn.conf.example
# and copy to /etc/inadyn.conf
start_inadyn="NO"

# To start the syslog daemon, set to "YES"
start_syslogd="NO"

# To start the Enlightenment Sound Daemon, set to "YES"
start_esd="NO"

# If you use a proxy server in your environment, specify it here
# for ViewML.
export VIEWML_PROXY=""

# Edit to change the font size automatically on boot
# Only works on DLDI builds
# For example: 
# font="/usr/share/consolefonts/alt-8x8.psf"
font=""
