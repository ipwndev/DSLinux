#	INSTRUCTIONS
#
# If you are using GBAMP. M3 CF or Supercard CF, copy this
# file to linux/etc/rc.conf on your CF card.
#
# If you are using the .nds version of DSLinux, copy this
# file to /var/rc.conf. Note that /var/rc.conf will not be
# preserved across reboots!
#
# If you are using the .ds.gba version of DSLinux, copy the
# file to /sram/rc.conf.
#
# The /sram filesystem needs to be initialised before it
# can be used. See http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Running_DSLinux
# for more information.
#
# Then edit the copy with vi.
# If you have never used vi before, see:
# 	http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Vi
# There is an introduction to vi on that page.

# This file provides default flags for the DSLinux boot process.
# The flags defined in this file can be either set or empty.
# If a flag is empty, it will not affect the system.

# This sets the hostname. You can set this to whatever you want.
hostname="NintendoDS"

# By default, wireless networking is not started on boot.
# If you want to enable it at boot time, set this flag to "YES".
enable_network_on_boot="NO"

# You can of course also configure networking manually (i.e. without
# the init scripts, e.g. by using a custom script), or save a
# configuration in /etc/rc.conf and start networking by running:
#	/etc/rc.d/network start
# and stop it by running:
#	/etc/rc.d/network stop

# Set the essid of your wireless router here.
# Example flags are:
# 	essid="eXampLeEsSiD"
# You cannot use wireless networking without setting an essid.
essid=""

# If DSLinux fails to associate with your access point,
# try setting you access point's channel here.
# For example:
#	channel="11"
channel=""

# Here you can set a wepkey. Both 64bit and 128bit keys are
# supported. For hex keys, just enter the key without any prefix:
#	wepkey="9923829ea8923"
# For ascii keys, make sure you use an 's:' prefix:
# 	wepkey="s:mysecretkey"
# If you do not want to use WEP, just leave this flag empty.
wepkey=""

# Set use_dhcp to "YES" if you want to use DHCP to configure
# your IP address and gateway address.
use_dhcp="NO"

# You can also assign a static IP and gateway instead of using DHCP.
# For example:
#	ip="192.168.1.42"
#	gateway="192.168.1.1"
# Note that these values are ignored if use_dhcp is set to "YES".
ip=""
gateway=""

# If using static network configuration, you can also supply a netmask
# and a broadcast address, if you want to.
netmask=""
broadcast=""

# If you want to start telnetd on boot, so you can login into your
# DS from your PC, set start_telnetd to "YES".
# Note that telnet sends passwords unencrypted over the network,
# and makes it easy to crack into your DS from outside. You should
# therefore not enable this if you use public wifi hotspots.
start_telnetd="NO"

# If you want to see your DS firmware version on boot,
# set this to "YES". By default, the firmware version is shown.
show_firmware_version="YES"

# End of file.
