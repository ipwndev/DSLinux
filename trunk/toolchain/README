a fast computer.

If you already have a devkitARM-based toolchain installed, you
should remove devkitARM binaries from your PATH *before* you
start building the new toolchain. You can also simply rename the
devkitARM directory to something else, for example devkitARM.dontuse.

You will need the following software installed on your system
for the build to succeed:

        * binutils
        * gcc
        * g++
        * make
        * patch
        * bzip2
        * GNU awk - most often called 'gawk'
        * wget

All this software should be packaged with any general purpose Linux
distribution.

The build will want to download a couple of files (about 30MB total).
If you want to get the files now and build the toolchain later, run:

        make fetch

To clean out files left over after the build, run:

        make clean

To remove *everything* INCLUDING THE COMPILED TOOLCHAIN, run:

        make nuke
             |
             +---- Use with caution!

If there is an error during the build, please try to paste at least
50 lines above the "make: Error X" line into your problem report.
Otherwise no one will be able to figure out the error.

Once the error is fixed (by you or someone else), run make again.
The build will continue from where it failed.

To use your self-compiled toolchain, run this command to put the
toolchain binaries in your PATH, assuming your dslinux source tree
resides in ~/dslinux:

        export PATH=~/dslinux/toolchain/prefix/bin:$PATH

Currently, you also have to make a small modification to the
file vendors/config/armnommu/config.arch to be able to use
the toolchain. Find the line that says:

        CROSS_COMPILE = arm-elf-

and change it to:

        CROSS_COMPILE = arm-linux-elf-        

Before compiling DSLinux with the new toolchain for the first
time, you should run make menuconfig and select the following
option:

  ---> Kernel/Library/Defaults Selection
    --->  [*] Default all settings (lose changes)

Otherwise your build might fail.

Good luck!
