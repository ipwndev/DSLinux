choice
	prompt "Target Processor Endianness"
	help
	  This is the endianness you wish to build use.  Choose either Big
	  Endian, or Little Endian.

config ARCH_LITTLE_ENDIAN
	bool "Little Endian"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_LITTLE_ENDIAN

config ARCH_BIG_ENDIAN
	bool "Big Endian"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN

config ARCH_HAS_NO_MMU
	bool
	default n

config ARCH_HAS_MMU
	bool "Target CPU has a memory management unit (MMU)"
	default y
	depends !ARCH_HAS_NO_MMU
	help
	  If your target CPU does not have a memory management unit (MMU), 
	  then answer N here.  Normally, Linux runs on systems with an MMU.  
	  If you are building a uClinux system, answer N.

	  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS
	bool "Enable floating point number support"
	default y
	help
	  This option allows you to entirely omit all floating point number
	  support from uClibc.  This will cause floating point functions like
	  strtod() to be omitted from uClibc.  Other floating point functions, 
	  such as printf() and scanf() will still be included in the library, 
	  but will not contain support for floating point numbers.

	  Answering N to this option can reduce the size of uClibc.  Most people
	  will answer Y.

config HAS_FPU
	bool "Target CPU has a floating point unit (FPU)"
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS
	default y
	help
	  If your target CPU does not have a Floating Point Unit (FPU) or a
	  kernel FPU emulator, but you still wish to support floating point
	  functions, then uClibc will need to be compiled with soft floating
	  point support (-msoft-float).  If your target CPU does not have an
	  FPU or an FPU emulator within the Linux kernel, then you should
	  answer N.

	  Most people will answer Y.

config UCLIBC_HAS_SOFT_FLOAT
	bool
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS && !HAS_FPU
	default y

config DO_C99_MATH
	bool "Enable full C99 math library support"
	depends on UCLIBC_HAS_FLOATS
	default n
	help
	  If you want the uClibc math library to contain the full set C99
	  math library features, then answer Y.  If you leave this set to
	  N the math library will contain only the math functions that were
	  listed as part of the traditional POSIX/IEEE 1003.1b-1993 standard.
	  Leaving this option set to N will save around 35k on an x86 system.

	  If your applications require the newer C99 math library functions, 
	  then answer Y.

config WARNINGS
	string "Compiler Warnings"
	default "-Wall"
	help
	  Set this to the set of gcc warnings you wish to see while compiling.

config KERNEL_SOURCE
	string "Linux kernel header location"
	default "/usr/src/linux"
	help
	  The kernel source you use to compile with should be the same as the
	  Linux kernel you run your apps on.  uClibc doesn't even try to achieve binary
	  compatibility across kernel versions.  So don't expect, for example, uClibc
	  compiled with Linux kernel 2.0.x to implement lchown properly, since 2.0.x
	  can't do that. Similarly, if you compile uClibc vs Linux 2.4.x kernel headers,
	  but then run on Linux 2.0.x, lchown will be compiled into uClibc, but won't
	  work at all.  You have been warned.

config UCLIBC_UCLINUX_BROKEN_MUNMAP
	bool
	depends on !ARCH_HAS_MMU
	default y

config EXCLUDE_BRK
	bool
	depends on !ARCH_HAS_MMU
	default y

config C_SYMBOL_PREFIX
	string
	default "_" if ARCH_HAS_C_SYMBOL_PREFIX
	default "" if !ARCH_HAS_C_SYMBOL_PREFIX

config HAVE_DOT_CONFIG
	bool
	default y
