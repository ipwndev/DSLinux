<h3>A C library for embedded Linux</h3>

uClibc (aka µClibc/pronounced yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing
embedded Linux systems.  It is much smaller than the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>, but nearly
all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc. Porting
applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves just recompiling the
source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries and threading.  It currently
runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> and <a
href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a> systems with
support for alpha, ARM, cris, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, PowerPC,
SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.

<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that
glibc is eating up too much space, you may want to consider using
uClibc.  If you are building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes
of storage, then using glibc may make more sense.  Unless, for
example, that 12 Terabytes will be Network Attached Storage and
you plan to burn Linux into the system's firmware...

<p>

uClibc is maintained by <a href=
"http://codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc. (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.
See the <a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a> for details.
