    Saying Y here allows for early-boot debugging of dslinux.
    With the nds console you can see messages printed before
    the framebuffer comes up. This is mostly used by dslinux
    developers for debugging.
    If unsure, say N.

config NDS_TEXT_CONSOLE_STEP_BY_STEP
   bool "Step-by-step debugging of the dslinux boot process"
   depends on NDS_TEXT_CONSOLE
   default n
   help
    Saying yes here will enable code that busy-waits for the A key
    to be pressed after printing a line to the console.
    This allows for step-by-step debugging of the dslinux boot
    process. You really only want this if you are debugging a
    boot problem.
    If in doubt, say N.
