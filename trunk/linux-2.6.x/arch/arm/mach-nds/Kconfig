	 With the nds console you can see messages printed before
	 the framebuffer comes up. This is mostly used by dslinux
	 developers for debugging.
	 If unsure, say N.

config NDS_TEXT_CONSOLE_STEP_BY_STEP
	bool "Step-by-step debugging of the dslinux boot process"
	depends on NDS_TEXT_CONSOLE
	default n
	help
	 Saying yes here will enable code that busy-waits for the A key
	 to be pressed after printing a line to the console.
	 This allows for step-by-step debugging of the dslinux boot
	 process. You really only want this if you are debugging a
	 boot problem.
	 If in doubt, say N.
