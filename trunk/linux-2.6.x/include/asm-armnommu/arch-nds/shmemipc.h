 * This file belongs to the framework for inter-processor-communication
 * used in dslinux. The DS has two processors, an arm7 and an arm9.
 * Each has dedicated tasks. The arm7 controls certain hardware devices
 * like the touchscreen, wifi and sound chips. The Linux kernel itself
 * runs only on the arm9, so this is not SMP!
 *
 * Think of the arm7 as a co-processor for certain tasks. Some drivers use
 * shared memory to pass data between the CPUs.
 * 
 * There are 3 ways for the 2 CPUs to communicate:
 *
 *  1. A hardware FIFO. See fifo.c for details.
 *     This is used by the touchscreen driver, for example.
 *  
 *  2. A shared memory region.
 *     Quoting http://neimod.com/dstek/dstek2.xml#Memory%20Map:
 *     
 *     Shared IWRAM. The name shared IWRAM (consists of 2 16kb blocks)
 *     can be misleading, as only one CPU has access to it.
 *     However, using WRAMCNT each 16k block can be assigned to a
 *     specific CPU. When processing is done for example, the block can
 *     be assigned to the other CPU quickly for processing, without copying
 *     it via main memory or the IPC fifo.
 *  
 *  3. A synchronization register.
 *     From http://neimod.com/dstek/dstek2.xml#Interprocessor%20Communication:
 *
 *     The ARM7 can trigger an interrupt on the ARM9 (and vice versa) by
 *     writing a 1 to bit 13 of the ARM7's REG_IPCSYNC. But, the ARM9 must
 *     allow this to happen by enabling bit 14 of ARM9's REG_IPCSYNC,
 *     and enable bit 16 of REG_IE.
 *
 * 
 * The shared memory framework uses the shared memory region for data to
 * be transferred, and the ipcsync for communication between the processors.
 * It is logically stacked between ipcsync and device drivers.
 * ipsync is below it and device drivers using shared memory to communicate
 * with devices behind the ARM7 are on top of it.
 *
 * The idea is as follows:
 *
 * The ARM7 writes to block 0 and reads from it when requested by the ARM9.
 * The ARM9 writes to block 1 and reads from it when requested by the ARM7.
 * 
 * Details:
 *
 * A driver that wants to communicate to the ARM7 via shared memory locks the
 * block (SHMEMIPC_BLOCK) and writes data to it.
 * Once the driver wants to send the data over to the ARM7, it calls
 * shmemipc_flush(). This will lock the block and send a SHMEMIPC_REQUEST_FLUSH
 * interrupt to the ARM7. The interrupt has a type specific to the driver, so
 * the ARM7 knows what area of the memory block it should read from, and which
 * device is the destination. Having read the data from the buffer the ARM7
 * will interrupt the kernel with SHMEMIPC_FLUSH_COMPLETE. The interrupt
 * handler will release the lock on the block. The transfer is complete.
 *
 * Communication from the ARM7 to the ARM9 works the same way. But because we
 * can only re-map blocks when running on the ARM9 and the ARM7 does not run
 * a multi-threaded kernel but a simple endless-loop program, the implementation
 * details vary between the two different CPUs.
 *
 * We might be sharing the ARM7 interrupt with other subsystems of the kernel.
 * The dispatcher in ipcsync.c takes care of this though.
 * We only get interrupts destined for us.
