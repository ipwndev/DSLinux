# This file provides default settings for the DSLinux boot process.

# It can be used as an example configuration file.
# Copy it to linux/etc/rc.conf on your CF card (for GBAMP, M3 CF
# and SC CF). Then edit the copy with vi.
# If you have never used vi before, see:
# 	http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/index.php/Using_DSLinux
# There is an introduction to vi on that page.

# Note that every line in this file starting with a '#' character
# is a comment. Comments are simply ignored by DSLinux.

# The settings you define in this file can be either set or empty.
# If a setting is empty, it will not affect the system.
# Most settings below are empty by default, like this:
# 	setting=""
# To set a setting, change it so there is text inside the quotes,
# like this:
#	setting="sometext"
# See the examples given in the comments for each setting to get
# an idea of what to set a setting to.

# This sets the hostname. You can set this to whatever you want.
hostname="NintendoDS"

# Set the essid and channel of your wireless router here.
# Example settings are:
# 	essid="eXampLeEsSiD"
# 	channel="11"
# Note that these settings are required for wireless networking.
# You cannot use wireless networking if these settings are empty.
essid=""
channel=""

# Here you can set a wepkey. Both 64bit and 128bit keys are
# supported. For hex keys, just enter the key without any prefix:
#	wepkey="9923829ea8923"
# For ascii keys, make sure you use an 's:' prefix:
# 	wepkey="s:mysecretkey"
wepkey=""

# Set use_dhcp to "YES" if you want to use DHCP to configure
# your IP address and gateway address.
use_dhcp="NO"

# Here you can also assign a static IP and gateway instead:
#	ip="192.168.1.42"
#	gateway="192.168.1.1"
# Note that these values are ignored if use_dhcp is set to "YES".
ip=""
gateway=""

# If you want to start telnetd on boot, so you can login into your
# DS from your PC, set start_telnetd to "YES".
# Note that telnet sends passwords unencrypted over the network,
# and makes it easy to crack into your DS from outside. You should
# therefore not enable this if you use public wifi hotspots.
start_telnetd="NO"

# If you want to see your DS firmware version on boot,
# set this to "YES". By default, the firmware version is shown.
show_firmware_version="YES"

# End of file.
