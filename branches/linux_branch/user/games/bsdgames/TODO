TODO list for bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
==============================================

Please let me (jsm@polyomino.org.uk) know if you're interested in
doing any of these, or have done work on them, so we can avoid
duplication of effort.  The order of entries is just the order they
were added in, not any priority order.

The file BUGS lists known bugs; you may wish to work on some of
those.  The issues listed there are not included in this list.

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  Most of
             this has been done, through adopting changes from
             OpenBSD, but a thorough audit is needed - see SECURITY.
	     The Linux Security Audit Project looked at the games but
             never bothered to send me their fixes; I think they are
             now included.  Rogue and tetris could probably be adapted
             to keep their score files open and so need no more
             privileges than an open file descriptor.  Sail could
             better use a daemon than a file for interfacing between
             multiple players; Paul Janzen might do this at some point.

1997-04-29 - Fix compilation warnings with increasingly strict warning
             options.  The main reasonable ones have now been done,
             but maybe some bits are left, and new warnings get added
             to new versions of GCC.  Fixes for -pedantic warnings are
             in progress.

1997-05-01 - Games with scorefiles should lock them when updating them.

1997-07-15 - Get distribution permission for larn.  Get licence of
             rogue clarified.  (See NetBSD PR 5850.  Note that the
             original author of larn, Noah Morgan, is dead.)

1998-07-28 - Support building in a directory other than the source directory.

1998-08-27 - Convert the games that use termcap to use curses.
             Currently these are backgammon, hack and tetris; rain,
             snake and worms have been done.  If it becomes possible
             to distribute larn, this will apply to it as well.

1998-08-27 - If we build a game that links to another game's manpage,
             but don't install the other game, then we get a dangling
             symlink or .so for the manpage.

1998-08-27 - Merge in improvements from OpenBSD.  Perhaps FreeBSD also
             has some; Paul Janzen is adding FreeBSD changes to
             OpenBSD, so they may reach me that way.

1998-09-11 - Move building of more files in which configuration
             variables are substituted from the configure script into
             the Makefiles.

1998-12-06 - Allow alternative dictionaries to be specified at runtime
             for boggle.

1998-12-11 - Support LFS (large files) - this requires using
             fseeko/ftello instead of fseek/ftell, where supported,
             and using -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 (actually getconf
             LFS_CFLAGS, getconf LFS_LDFLAGS and getconf LFS_LIBS),
             and could be useful with the kernel support for 32 bit
             uids in Linux 2.4, when there could be sparse score files
             (indexed by uid) over 2Gb.

1998-12-14 - Check for any more constant data that could be marked
             const.

1998-12-28 - Fix any places that use the pid as random seed to use
             something else, such as the time, because the pid is bad
             when people boot up their system just to play a game and
             so it is constant.

1999-07-29 - Provide support for giving each setgid game its own gid.

2000-09-09 - Fuzz testing (i.e., pass random input to games in an
             attempt to crash them).  Some bugs have been found and
             fixed in battlestar through this already.  It probably
             works best with GCC bounded pointers.

2000-09-09 - Support for HURD-based GNU systems.  This may now (2.13)
             work.

2000-09-24 - Fix any and all date-related bugs (Y2038, Y10K, etc.) so
             that the games will work on any date provided only that
             time_t is big enough.
