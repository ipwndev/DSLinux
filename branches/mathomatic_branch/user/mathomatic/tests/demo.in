y=x_new^n
taylor x_new 1 x_old ; build the root approximation equation
x_new ; solve for the wanted variable
simplify ; convergent, iterative root approximation equation:
copy ; copy the equation to a new equation space
replace x_new x_old with x
x ; make sure it is correct by solving for x

; find the derivative of (1/(x^.5)) the hard way:
a=(1/(x+l)^.5-1/x^.5)/l
limit l 0 ; take the limit as l goes to 0
integrate x ; take the anti-derivative and see if it's right

; an inverse cubic equation:
y=x^(1/3)+x^(2/3)
x ; solve for x
simplify

e#^x
taylor x 10 0 ; generate a 10th order taylor series from the exponential function
laplace x ; do a Laplace transform on it
laplace inverse x ; undo the transform
