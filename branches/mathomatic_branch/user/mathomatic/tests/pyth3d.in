; This input to Mathomatic arrives at the distance between two points
; in 3D space from the Pythagorean theorem (distance between two points
; in 2D space).

l^2=(x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2 ; Distance formula for 2D space.
d^2=l^2+(z1-z2)^2 ; Add another leg.
eliminate l ; Combine the two equations.
d ; Solve to get the distance formula for 3D space.
; The coordinate of point 1 is (x1, y1, z1) and point 2 is (x2, y2, z2).
