<h2>Notes on the Limitations of Computer Algebra Systems</h2>
<h4><i>by George Gesslein II</i></h4>
</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Having written a general purpose CAS (Computer Algebra System),
I feel qualified to write about them.
<p>
The first powerful CAS ever written is called Macsyma.
Macsyma is a LISP program, started in the late 1960s, that is still
being used to this day (see <a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net">Maxima</a>
and <a href="http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net">wxMaxima</a>).
LISP is well suited to do symbolic mathematical processing,
while the C programming language is good at numeric math and logic.
LISP is archaic and a better language is needed.
<p>
The C programming language became very popular in the 1980s,
and Mathematica, Maple, and
<a href="http://www.mathomatic.org">Mathomatic</a>
were born.
Because it is difficult to do symbolic math
in C, but easy to write other languages in C, Mathematica and Maple
have their own programming language.
Mathomatic was a struggle to code, because it is written entirely
in C and has no programming capability.
This is the reason for its main limitation:
No symbolic logarithms or trigonometry.
Trigonometry as complex exponentials should work, though.

<h3>Rule-Based Manipulations and Heuristics</h3>
<p>
All CASes use rule-based transformations and manipulations.
Heuristics (the trial and error, or brute force approach)
are used, too.
A totally heuristic CAS would eventually succeed at simplifying any
mathematical expression to its smallest possible size.
It would do this by applying every combination of algebraic rules
to every part of the expression in an intelligent way to produce
the maximum simplification.
A totally heuristic CAS is not practical as a general purpose algebra
system, but would be nice to have, if you needed perfect simplification.
<p>
Mathomatic uses a little heuristics in its solve routine,
and in its
<a href="am.html#simplify">"smart divide"</a>
routine.  Other than that, it intelligently
applies the rules of algebra to arrive at the best answer without
heuristics.  This means the simplified result may not be the smallest
possible, but it will be easy to read and probably the answer wanted.

<h3>Writing Your Own CAS</h3>
<p>
Even if you are thick-headed like me,
writing your own CAS will give you first-hand experience with the
beauty of mathematics and make you smarter.
For every algebraic rule you implement, you will need its inverse, too.
<p>
Most CASes use dynamically allocated tree structures
for storing mathematical expressions.
Mathomatic uses simple, fixed-size arrays with alternating elements
of operand/operator for expressions.
Each level of parentheses is indicated by a level number
in each element (origin 1).
This method of storage is OK for basic math,
but won't work for more advanced math, where functions
can have more than two parameters, and matrices are required.
I designed it that
way because it is easy for me to understand and write code
for it.  And I didn't want a lot of memory fragmentation,
which is what you will get when dynamically allocating
and freeing a lot of different sized objects in C.
<p>
You will need to decide on how to represent constants.
The standard floating point arithmetic is OK, but it has problems
representing fractions and the round-off error accumulates.
Fractions (rational arithmetic) are very important in a CAS.
The commercial CASes use their own numeric math library,
which allow very large and long numbers and fractions.
<p>
Solving in Mathomatic is almost entirely based on the rule:
<pre>
    y = f(x)
    g(y) = g(f(x))
</pre>
where f() and g() are any function, and:
<pre>
    arcf(y) = arcf(f(x))
    arcf(y) = x
</pre>
<p>
where arcf() is the inverse function of f().
An equality will remain an equality
when both sides of the equation are operated on by the same
mathematical operation.
Some simplification is also necessary during solving.
<p>
Mathomatic has proved it is practical and efficient to do
generalized polynomial operations.  By generalized, we mean that
the coefficients of polynomials are not specially treated or stored in any way.
They are not separated out from the main variable of the polynomial.
Maximum simplification of all expressions is not possible unless everything is generalized.
<p>
Have fun, and remember to value life!
