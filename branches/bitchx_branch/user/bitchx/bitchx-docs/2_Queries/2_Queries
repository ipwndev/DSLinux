Section 2: Server Queries                                                   

This section addresses the other half of EPIC's must-know commands, server
queries.  These are commands that, in one way or another, ask an irc server
for some information.  This might entail a listing of current channels, a
list of people on your current channel, or some detailed information about
a particular user.

These commands aren't quite as important as those in Section 1, but you
should make yourself familiar with them.
