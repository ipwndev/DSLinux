Synopsis:
   wii [<nickname>[ <nickname>[ ...]]]

Description:
   The WII command is used to retrieve detailed information about the 
   nickname(s) specified.  This will always include the user's
   nickname, address (user@hostname), real name (IRCNAME), and the server
   that user is on.  It may also show what channels the user is on (if
   any, and if they aren't +p/+s) and whether the user is +o/+v in any of
   those channels, whether the user is away, and if the user is an irc
   operator. WII also displays the idle time of that nick.

   If no arguments are given, the WII will be performed on the client 
   itself.

Examples:
   To get information on users JoeBob, ToeJam, and JuneBug:
      /wii joebob toejam junebug

See Also:
   who(2); whowas(2) whois(2)

Restrictions:
   In WII output, only channels that are not +p or +s are shown, unless
   the client happens to be on one of those channels.

Other Notes:
   In addition to idle time, some servers also return the time the user
   signed on to irc.

   If you query a remote server for WHOIS information, there is no reliable
   way to "wait" for the data to come back (i.e. WAIT will be useless).
