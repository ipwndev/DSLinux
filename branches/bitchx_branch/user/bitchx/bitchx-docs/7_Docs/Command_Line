Command Line Usage of BitchX                                               

The BitchX irc client has a number of options available to it from the command
line.  The basic command-line syntax is:

   BitchX [<switches>] [<nickname> [<server list>]]

The nickname may be at most 30 characters long.  The server list may be a
space-delimited list of server addresses.  Each server name may use the
server:port notation if a port other than the default (usually 6667) is
desired.  The available switches are as follows:

   -b         loads ~/.ircrc at client startup, instead of on connect
   -c <chan>  makes client join given channel on startup (if possible)
   -p <port>  set a different default port (normally 6667)
   -f         let terminal handle flow control (^S/^Q)
   -F         let the client handle flow control (default)
   -s         do not connect on startup, but show server list instead
   -S         use a separate server processes, ircserv
   -d         run the client in "dumb" terminal mode
   -q         skip loading of ~/.ircrc startup file
   -a         add default servers and command line servers to server list
   -x         run the client in "debug" mode
   -v         print the client's version string and exit
   -b         force the client to fork and return you to your shell
   -l <file>  loads <file> in place of your .ircrc
   -L <file>  loads <file> in place of your .ircrc and expands $ expandos

Unlike other Unix programs, switches for BitchX cannot be combined. 
Something like "-db" is not allowed, "-d -b" must be used.
