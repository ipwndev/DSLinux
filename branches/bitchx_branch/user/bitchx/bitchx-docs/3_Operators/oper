Synopsis:
   oper [<nick> [<password>]]

Description:
   The OPER command is used to gain irc operator status on the current
   server, with the stipulation that the specified (or current) nickname
   and password match an O: line entry in the server's configuration.
   If a password is not specified, the client will prompt for one.

See Also:
   deop(3); mode(1)

Restrictions:
   Unlike DEOP, the MODE command cannot be used to gain operator status.

Other Notes:
   Specifying the password on the input line is not recommended, for many
   reasons, the most obvious being that anyone with a line of sight to your
   monitor can see what your password is.  When the client prompts for a
   password, it does not display it as it is typed.  Further, the client's
   command history may be written to a file, which would compromise the
   password if the history file is world-readable.
