Synopsis:
   hash

Description:
   This command is primarily for debugging the irc server.  It is used to
   profile the server's internal use of its hashed records.  It does not
   actually do anything useful on the network, and is of little use to
   anyone other than server programmers.

Restrictions:
   The protocol HASH command is only available (or at least only produces
   useful output) when the irc server is compiled in debug mode.  Its use
   is limited to irc operators.
