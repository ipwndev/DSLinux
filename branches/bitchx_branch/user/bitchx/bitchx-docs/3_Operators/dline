Synopsis:
   dline <user@host>,<user@host> :<comment>

Description:
   DLINE is used to block a client from the irc server.  It works
   similarly to a KLINE, except that a reason must be given (even if it
   is meaningless or flat-out wrong). Multiple user@host may be specified
   using comma's. The ":" specify's the comment. 

Restrictions:
   This command is limited to irc operators.
