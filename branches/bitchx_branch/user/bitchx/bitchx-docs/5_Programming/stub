Synopsis:
   stub alias|assign <alias/var>[,<alias/var>] <filename> [<filename> ...]

Description:
   The STUB command allows for a sort of dynamic script loading.  Any
   alias or variable name may be associated with a file; that alias or
   variable effectively becomes a stub for that file, a placeholder.
   When that alias/variable is accessed, the file is loaded.

   Stubs are always cleared when the alias or variable associated with
   them is accessed.  That is, calling the variable again will not
   reload the same file.  Stubs are also cleared any time a stubbed
   file is loaded.  The file that is loaded does not necessarily need
   to contain to redefine the alias or variable associated with it.
   Finally, Stubs may load more than one file at a time.

Examples:
   To load the file foobar.irc when the /foo command is issued:
      stub alias foo foobar.irc
      
   To load footoo.irc when $foo and $bar are accessed:
      stub assign foo,bar footoo.irc

Other Notes:
   STUB is not a memory management tool.  Its purpose is to minimize the
   client's overhead at it initially starts up.  Files that are loaded
   with STUB are not automatically unloaded later.
