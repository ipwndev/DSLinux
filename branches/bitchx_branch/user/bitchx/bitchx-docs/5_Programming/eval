Synopsis:
   eval <commands>

Description:
   EVAL takes the commands given it and passes them through EPIC's internal
   inline parser before executing them.  This means that variables will be
   expanded once, and the command terminator (;) is honored.  This has the
   same effect as executing a command with INPUT_ALIASES turned on.

Examples:
   To force the display of a variable when not inside an alias:
      eval echo The variable's value is $foo

See Also:
   set(4) input_aliases

Other Notes:
   Care should be taken when using EVAL with untrusted input.  If EVAL
   must be used, it is important to first strip out any characters that
   have special meaning to the inline parser, such as ';'.  Using EVAL in
   this manner can very easily lead to a hijacked client or compromised
   account.
