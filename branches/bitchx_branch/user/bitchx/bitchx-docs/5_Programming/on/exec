Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]exec [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever an EXECed process generates output to
   standard output.

Parameters:
   $0    the pid of the EXECed process that triggered the hook (an internal
         | number, not the system pid); if the process was started with the
         | -name switch, the name specified is returned instead
   $1-   a line of the process's output stderr

Examples:
   To distinguish process output from other window output:
      on ^exec "*" {
         echo [$0] $1-
      }
