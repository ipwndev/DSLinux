Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]channel_signoff [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client observes someone signoff from
   irc.  It is not hooked when the client itself signs off.

Parameters:
   $0    the channel the signoff was observed on
   $1    the nickname of the person leaving irc
   $2-   signoff message

Examples:
   To distinguish signoffs from one channel to another:
      on ^channel_nick "*" {
         if ( [$0] == C ) {
            echo *** Signoff by $1 \($2-\)
         } {
            echo *** Signoff by $1 from $0 \($2-\)
         }
      }

Other Notes:
   This hook is not triggered by the client exiting irc.  Use the QUIT hook
   to perform an action when the client quits.  This hook differs from the
   SIGNOFF hook in that this is triggered for every channel on which the
   person is observed signing off.
