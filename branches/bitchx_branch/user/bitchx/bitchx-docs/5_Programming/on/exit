Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]exit [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered when the client is about to exit normally (from
   the QUIT command, etc.).  It is mostly useful for doing cleanup before
   exiting, such as saving any current settings.  It cannot be used to
   trap the QUIT command; the client will exit immediately after this
   hook is triggered..

Parameters:
   $0    always the string "Exiting"

Examples:
   Save current settings before exiting:
      on ^exit "*" {
         save all
         echo Now exiting ircII-${J}...
      }
