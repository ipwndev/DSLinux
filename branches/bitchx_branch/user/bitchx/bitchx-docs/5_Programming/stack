Synopsis:
   stack push|pop|list alias|assign|on|set [<item>]

Description:
   STACK is a convenient mechanism for storing current aliases, variables,
   and hooks in a stack.  New aliases, variables, or hooks with the same
   names or scopes can be created without disturbing the stacked ones.
   Those that are stacked can be restored at any time (clobbering any
   current settings in favor of the saved ones).

   There are three commands currently available to STACK.  The first, push,
   pushes an item onto a stack bearing its name.  The second, pop, removes
   the most recent pushed item off its stack.  The last, list, shows the
   contents of the named stack.

Examples:
   To push the current WHO hook onto the stack:
      stack push on who

   To pop the most recently pushed $foo variable off its stack:
      stack pop assign foo

   To list the current alias stack:
      stack list alias

See Also:
   alias(5); assign(5); on(5)

Bugs:
   STACK LIST works, but not quite as one would expect.  Instead of listing
   each individual alias, variable, or hook separately, all are clumped
   together.  Their order is correct, but the output may be confusing.
