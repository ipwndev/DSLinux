Section 5: Programming EPIC                                                 

This section is mostly of interest to programmers.  EPIC provides a rich,
feature-filled scripting language that allows you to customize the client
to no end.

Detailed in this section are the language's various control structures
(conditional and looping statements), methods for dealing with variables,
procedures (called aliases) and other data structures, methods for
script inclusion in other files, and much, much more.

A collection of built-in functions is in the next section.
