Synopsis:
   load [-args] <file> [<file> ...]

Description:
   LOAD allows for commands contained in external files to be executed.
   This has the obvious use of setting up aliases and hooks without having
   to type each one in individually.  The .ircrc file, for example, it
   automatically loaded when the client is started (assuming the -q switch
   isn't used).

   When attempting to load a script, the client will first search the
   directories in the LOAD_PATH for the desired file.  The client will
   also accept an absolute pathname.

   The syntax of an ircII-EPIC script file is rather relaxed.  It mostly
   resembles C code, aesthetically.  As with C, whitespace is usually not
   significant, except in literal text.  Curly braces used for complex
   commands may be placed anywhere.
   
   As with the input line, commands issued directly in a loaded script
   are, by default, not evaluated.  This means that aliases and functions
   will not be expanded, and semicolons are not honored.  This can be
   overridden script-wide with the -args switch, or by turning the
   INPUT_ALIASES setting on inside the script.  EVAL should be used if
   only select lines need to be evaluated.

   If the filename ends in a .tcl extension, the file is automatically
   passed to the tcl interpreter if possible.

Options:
   -args   This switch causes the script to be loaded with INPUT_ALIASES
           turned on.  In addition, commands may use the special numeric
           expandos ($*, $2, etc.), which will expand to the arguments
           passed to LOAD.

Other Notes:
   A large collection of sample scripts is included with the client.  Refer
   to Section 8, the Script Library, for more information.
