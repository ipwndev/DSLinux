Synopsis:
   $rmdir(<directory> [<directory> ...])

Technical:
   This function unlinks the specified directories from the filesystem.  As
   with the normal shell mechanism, the directory must be empty before it
   can be removed.  Tilde-expansion is permitted.

Practical:
   One practical use for this function might be to remove any temporary
   directories created by a script installation program.  Other than that,
   there aren't many common uses for this function.

Returns:
    0   successfully removed all directories given
   >0   number of directories that could not be removed

Examples:
   $rmdir(~/temp)             returns 0 if ~/temp is empty
   $rmdir(~/temp /etc)        probably will return 1, unless you're root

See Also:
   mkdir(6)

Bugs:
   When $rmdir() fails to some extent, it shows how many directories could
   not be removed, but does not say which ones.  This isn't necessarily a
   bug, but it could be bothersome.
