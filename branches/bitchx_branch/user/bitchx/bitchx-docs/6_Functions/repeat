Synopsis:
   $repeat(<count> <text>)

Technical:
   This function returns a string composed of the input text concatenated
   to itself the specified number of times.

Practical:
   This function has many potential uses.  For example, it would be used to
   format output from a script such that it is always the width of the
   current window.  This has the side bonus of removing the need to hard-
   code formatting devices (table headers and such), which tend to look
   rather messy in source code.

Returns:
   input string repeated count times

Examples:
   $repeat(5 hello)                   returns "hellohellohellohellohello"
   $repeat(5  )                       returns "     "  (spaces)
