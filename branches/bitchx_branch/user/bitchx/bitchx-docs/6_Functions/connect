Synopsis:
   $connect(<host> <port>)

Technical:
   This function opens a raw TCP connection to the specified remote host on
   the specified remote port.  It returns a unique file descriptor for the
   connection that can be used by DCC RAW to communicate with the host.

Practical:
   This function attempts to open up a TCP socket to the given host on the
   given port.  DCC RAW is used to read and write data from and to it.
   This function effectively permits EPIC to act as a client for any
   TCP service.  In the past, people have used it for direct finger, whois,
   and simple ftp access.

Returns:
   file descriptor for connection, or nothing if error

Examples:
   $connect(127.0.0.1 25)           connect to your local mail server
   $connect(ftp.neato.org 21)       connect to an EPIC ftp site
   $connect(0.0.0.0 0)              error (no such host/port)
