Synopsis:
   $numwords(<word list>)

Technical:
   This function serves as a replacement for the $#var notation when you
   want to count the words in a string not held in a variable.

Practical:
   This function is used to count the number of words in an arbitrary
   string.  Normally, you could get this value with the $#var form, but
   that doesn't work for parameter expandos or function return values.

Returns:
   number of words in given string

Examples:
   $numwords(hello there bob)                returns 3
   $numwords()                               returns 0
