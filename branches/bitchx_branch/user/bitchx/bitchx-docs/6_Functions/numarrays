Synopsis:
   $numarrays()

Technical:
   This function shows the total number of arrays created by $setitem().
   It takes no arguments, and ignores any passed to it.

Practical:
   This function is used to show how many arrays currently exist.  This
   might be useful if the arrays were named in a sequential order, thus
   allowing you to know what the next available number is.

Returns:
   > 0   number of current arrays
     0   no arrays found
