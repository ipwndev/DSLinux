Synopsis:
   $match(<pattern> <word list>)
   $rmatch(<word> <pattern list>)

Technical:
   The $match() function searches through a word list and returns the index
   to the word that best matches the given pattern.  Its opposite is the
   $rmatch() function, which tries to match a pattern with a list of words.
   The index counts from 1.

Practical:
   These functions are generally most useful for automated processes.  For
   instance, one could try to match a person's address with a predefined
   list of address patterns to see if the client should automatically
   accept channel invitations or DCC CHAT requests.  Because they return
   the index to the best match, and not the matching item, they are mostly
   useful for boolean-type comparisons.

Returns:
    0   no matches found
   >0   index to best match in list

Examples:
   $match(*oo* blah foo booya)                              returns 2
   $match(*oo* blah fubar erf)                              returns 0
   $rmatch(joebob!jbriggs@drivein.com *.com *jbriggs@*)     returns 2
   $rmatch(joebob!jbriggs@drivein.com *.net *jimbob*)       returns 0
