Synopsis:
   notice [=]<nickname> <text to send>
   notice <channel> <text to send>
   notice %<process id|process name> <text to send>

 
Description:
   NOTICE is functionally equivalent to MSG.  Like MSG, it may send to
   a person or a channel, and may send to more than one target.  The command
   was primarily intended as a message type that guaranteed no automated
   responses.  See MSG for more information.

See Also:
   msg(1); on(5) notice, public_notice, send_notice

Restrictions:
   The IRC protocol explicitly prohibits any client from automatically
   responding to NOTICE with a MSG, CTCP, another NOTICE, or anything
   else, and ircII-EPIC will do everything in its power to prevent you
   from doing it :)
