Synopsis:
   server [-ssl] [<server name>|<server index> [<port>]]
   server [-add] <server>[:[<port>][:[<password>][:[<nickname>]]]]
   server [+|-][<server name>]
   server [-delete <server index>]

Description:
   The SERVER command allows you to manipulate your client's internal
   list of servers, as well as to switch servers.  If no arguments are
   given, your current server list is printed.  Any attempt to connect to
   a new server not already in your list will append it to your list.
   Additionally, servers can be associated with specific ircII windows,
   which can be useful when being on multiple networks at once.

   Your initial server list is compiled into the client.  This is usually
   a minimal list.  This is overridden if the client can find the system-
   wide ircII.servers file, which is usually a bit more extensive.  Users
   can further override this file's list by setting their respective
   IRCSERVER environment variables.
 
Options:
   +<server>  associate a new server to your current window (this will
                also connect you to that server)
   -<server>  disassociate a server from your current window (this will
                also disconnect you from that server)
   -add       add a server to your server list
   -delete    delete server with given server index from your list
   -ssl       enables SSL support on this server

Examples:
   To change to a new server, irc.foobar.com, on port 6668:
      /server irc.foobar.com 6668
      /server irc.foobar.com:6668

   To change to a new server and register with the nickname "JoeBob":
      /server irc.foobar.com:::JoeBob

   To switch to the next, or previous, server in your list
      /server +
      /server -

   To associate a new server, irc.booya.net, to your current window:
      /server +irc.booya.net

   To delete server 5 from your list:
      /server -delete 5

   To add server "irc.foo.com" on port 6667 with nick "blah" to your list:
      /server -add irc.foo.com:6667::blah
