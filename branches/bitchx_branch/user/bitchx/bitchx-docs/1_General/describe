Synopsis:
   describe <nickname|channel> <action description>

Description:
   DESCRIBE lets you perform an action.  It lets you describe what you're
   doing as though someone is watching you, rather than you telling them.
   You may send an action to either an individual or to an entire channel.

Examples:
   If your nickname is foobar, and you want to send an action to your
   friend whose nickname is booya:
      /describe booya is eating pizza

   To send an action to channel #blah:
      /describe #blah is eating pizza

   Anyone receiving an action from you will see something like this:
      * foobar is eating pizza

Aliases:
   DESCRIBE is identical to CTCP ACTION.  When sending an action to a
   channel, it functions identically to the ME command.

See Also:
   ctcp(1) action; load(5) action, mudlike; me(1); on(5) action,
   send_action

Restrictions:
   This command makes use of CTCP (client-to-client protocol), which is not
   part of the IRC protocol.  Most modern IRC clients understand CTCP, but
   not all do, while others might not support the same CTCP commands that
   ircII-EPIC supports.  If you receive an error of some sort, then the
   client on the receiving end is unable to properly handle your CTCP
   message.
