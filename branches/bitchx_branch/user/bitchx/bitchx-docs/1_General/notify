Synopsis:
   notify [[-]<nickname> [[-]<nickname> ...]]
   notify <+|->

Description:
   The NOTIFY command lets you specify a list of nicknames to watch for,
   and will notify you any time a specified nickname signs on or signs off
   IRC.  A "signoff" message will be generated if the person changes his
   or her nickname, so keep this in mind.

Options:
   -   When used alone, this will clear your notify list.  When used with
         a nickname, it will remove that nick from the list.
   +   This will display any nicks on your notify list who are signed on.

Examples:
   To add your friends scuba and diver to your notify list:
      /notify scuba diver

   To remove your ex-friend buddha from your notify list:
      /notify -buddha

   To clear your notify list:
      /notify -

   To show your friends that are current logged on irc:
      /notify +

Restrictions:
   Everyone asks, so here's a formal answer before you ask.  No, you cannot
   specify a nick!user@host mask to notify, nor can you specify wildcards.
   NOTE allows for this functionality, but not all servers enable it.

Bugs:
   If you redefine the numeric 303 hook, be careful!  NOTIFY absolutely
   depends on this numeric, and redefining the default behavior will
   probably trash your NOTIFY output.
