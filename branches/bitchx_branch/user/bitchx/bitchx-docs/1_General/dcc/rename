Synopsis:
   dccrename [<nick>] <name> [<new name>]
   dccrename -chat <nick> <new nick>


Description:
   This renames an incoming file from a DCC GET connection, or optionally
   a nick in a DCC CHAT. For files, this is useful if one with the same name
   already exists, so that it doesn't get overwritten. If the new name isn't
   specified, it is assumed the name given is the new name, and it is applied
   to the oldest existing DCC GET connection.

Options:
   -chat      rename a nick in DCC CHAT instead of a file

Examples:
   To rename file foo to bar from joebob:
      /dcc rename joebob foo bar

   To rename joebob to jimbob in a DCC CHAT:
      /dcc rename -chat joebob jimbob
