Synopsis:
   load brc

Description:
   This script will give the client the look and feel of the BITNET Relay
   Chat program (BiRC).  While it makes every attempt to mimic BiRC, some
   BiRC features simply have no equivalent on irc (the appropriate error
   message willl be returned).

     Alias       Description
     /c          same as CHANNEL (JOIN)
     /contact    same as ADMIN
     /getop      do a WALLOPS for help (depricated)
     /h          view this document
     /i <x>      invite last MSG sender to specified channel
     /ign <X>    ignore specified user with level ALL
     /irchelp    same as HELP
     /lcl        same as WHO with -s switch
     /m          same as MSG
     /na         same as NAMES with -pub switch
     /ni         same as NICK
     /rates      same as STATS, type l
     /st         same as /r
     /sw         same as NAMES
     /t          same as TOPIC
     /unignore   ignore specified user with level NONE
     /users      same as LUSERS
     /w          same as WHO
     /whoi       same as WHOIS

   The following BiRC commands are unavailable, either because they are not
   necessary, or because they have no meaning on irc: OPN, REGISTER, RULES,
   SE, SIGNON, SINCE, and TL.  Other BiRC commands have identical
   equivalents in the client, and thus are undocumented here.

   names(2); nick(1); stats(2); topic(1); wallops(2); who(2); whois(2)

Restrictions:
   The /getop alias probably won't work, since normal users are not allowed
   to use WALLOPS anymore.
