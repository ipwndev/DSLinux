Synopsis:
   load commander

Description:
   This script sets a number of meta-key bindings.  Each key is bound to
   some commonly-used function.  All of the keys shown are prefixed with
   the ESC key.

Bugs:
   The /countrywho alias is no longer present in any script distributed with
   the client.  Thus, ESC-d will fail.

Other Notes:
   This script assumes that META1_CHARACTER has been bound to the escape
   key.  If not, use the appropriate meta key.  It was written by Carl von
   Loesch (lynx).
