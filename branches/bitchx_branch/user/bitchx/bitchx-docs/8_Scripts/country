Synopsis:
   load country

Description:
   This script is used for converting between a country's (official) name
   and its ISO country code.  It can convert in either direction, and can
   convert to a country name based on an email address.  Everything is
   done through a single alias, /country.  The basic syntax is:

     /country [<switch>] <nickname|country|isometric>

   The default behavior is for the script to try to guess what type of
   input it has been given.  The default is a nickname.  If it cannot find
   anyone on irc with that nickname, it checks the length of the input.
   If it is longer than 3 (three) characters, a country name is assumed.
   If all else fails, it tries an isometric code.  Several switches are
   available to force the client to do a particular type of lookup
   (instead of guessing).

     Flag   Purpose                                                       
      -c    assume input is definitely a country name
      -f    skips userhost lookup used in nickname searches
      -i    assume input is definitely an ISO code
      -n    ignored (historical feature)

   For convenience, 2 additional aliases are provided; /lcountry is the
   same as /country -c, and /lcode is the same as /country -i.

Other Notes:
   This script was originally written by Daniel Cedras (TG).  It has been
   largely rewritten by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net, to take
   advantage of EPIC's features.
