Synopsis:
   load modes

Description:
   This script is mostly of historical significance.  It does in script what
   it now available with the MODE_STRIPPER setting and the MODE_STRIPPED
   hook.  Use them instead, they are far more efficient.

   The script implements a script-based mode stripper, meaning it takes the
   arguments received by the MODE hook and breaks them down into their
   individual mode changes, allowing them to be processed more easily.
