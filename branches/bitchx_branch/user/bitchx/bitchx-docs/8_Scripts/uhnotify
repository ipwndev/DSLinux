Synopsis:
   load uhnotify

Description:
   This script compliments NOTIFY, in that it adds the address of any user
   that a signon is detected for.  It does rely on USERHOST (hence its
   name), so the response time may be slightly delayed.

See Also:
   load(5); notify(1); usernost(2)

Other Notes:
   This script was written by Matthew Green (phone), mrg@mame.mu.oz.au.  The
   author has explicitly placed it in the public domain.
