Synopsis:
   set show_numerics [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, for any server response that includes a numeric reply
   or error code, the client will prepend that number to the message it
   displays, in lieu of the usual "***" shown.  This is mostly only used
   for informational purposes, though it can be useful in learning how
   the server works.

Other Notes:
   Not all server replies have numeric codes.  Additionally, the client
   may suppress some, if the client has a named hook for that reply.
