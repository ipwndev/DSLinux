Synopsis:
   set auto_whowas [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting will cause the client to automatically
   issue a WHOWAS for any WHOIS query that returns an error (generally
   meaning the queried nickname is not on irc).  The client will limit
   the number of WHOWAS replies displayed to the number specified by
   the NUM_OF_WHOWAS variable.

   If this variable is turned off, the client will not automatically
   send a WHOWAS after any failed WHOIS query.
