Synopsis:
   set display_ansi [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting will cause the client to allow escape
   sequence color and highlight codes to be passed to the display window.
   All other recognizable escape sequences will be removed.

   If turned off, the behavior is to convert all instances of ^[ (the ESC
   character) to [.

   This setting only affects the display window, not the status bar. This has
   the advantage of allowing ECHO and other commands to display special ANSI
   escape sequences for color and highlighting, etc.

   Note that this setting is meaningless unless set(4) color is turned ON.

   set(4) color, display; echo(5); xecho(5)

Other notes
   Also note that due to ircII-EPIC's new behavior of removing all unrecognized
   escape sequences, the client is no longer vulnerable to "flash" attacks and
   such evil ANSI codes that could scramble a vt100-compatible display.
