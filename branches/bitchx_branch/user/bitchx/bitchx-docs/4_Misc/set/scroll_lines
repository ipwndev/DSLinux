Synopsis:
   set scroll_lines [<number>]

Description:
   This setting offers a compromise of sorts between the available modes
   of the SCROLL variable.  When the last line of the display contains
   text, the client will scroll all text upward by the number of lines
   specified.  The normal behavior uses a setting of 1 (one).  If it is
   set to 0 (zero), the client automatically turns SCROLL off, and it
   must be manually enabled again to turn scrolling back on.
