Synopsis:
   set tab_max [<number>]

Description:
   This setting limits the number of tab characters allowed to be displayed
   in any single message.  If more tabs than the specified number are
   present in a message, only the specified number are displayed; the rest
   are replaced with Is.

   If this variable is set to 0 (zero), all tabs are displayed, no matter
   how many.  This setting has no effect if TAB is turned off.
