Synopsis:
   set flood_rate [<number>]

Description:
   This variable sets the message rate (per second) that will trigger the
   FLOOD hook, if the total message count exceeds the FLOOD_AFTER setting
   at the given rate.  Thus, if messages from a remote client outpace the
   FLOOD_RATE for at least FLOOD_AFTER messages, the FLOOD hook is caught.
   If FLOOD_RATE is larger than FLOOD_AFTER, the client will not trigger
   the hook until at least FLOOD_RATE messages have been received.
