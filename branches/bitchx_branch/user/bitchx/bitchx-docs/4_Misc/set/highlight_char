Synopsis:
   set highlight_char [bold|inverse|underline|<string>]

Description:
   This setting determines how "highlighted" messages are to be displayed.
   Messages from a user are tagged to be highlighted when the IGNORE
   command is used, and the user's nick!user@host pattern is prepended
   with a '+'.

   The highlight character may be any of "bold", "inverse", or "underline",
   or any arbitrary string.  Typically the string will contain some ANSI
   escape sequence that will do its own highlighting of the text.
