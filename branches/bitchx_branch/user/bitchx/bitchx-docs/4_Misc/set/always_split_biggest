Synopsis:
   set always_split_biggest [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting causes all new windows to split the largest
   window on-screen in half to make room for it.  If off, the current
   window is split, unless it is too small to accommodate both windows, in
   which case the largest will be split anyway.
