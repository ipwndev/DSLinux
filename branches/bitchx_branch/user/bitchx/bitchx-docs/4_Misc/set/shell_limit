Synopsis:
   set shell_limit [<number>]

Description:
   This setting is used to limit the amount of data returned by an EXECed
   command. The client will only display the specified number of lines of
   output, then will close the process.  This is mostly useful to prevent
   doing something accidentally that will generate gobs of output, such
   as recursively listing the root directory.

   If set to 0 (zero), the client does not limit the amount of output.
