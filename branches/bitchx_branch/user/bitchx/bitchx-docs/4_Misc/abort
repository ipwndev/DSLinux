Synopsis:
   abort [<filename>]

Description:
   This command causes two things to happen, after which the client exits
   immediately.

   First, a SAVE is performed, with the data dumped either to the specified
   file, or to "irc.aborted" if none.  Second, it will drop a core file in
   the current directory.

   This command is used mainly for debugging purposes.

See Also:
   quit(1); save(5)

Restrictions:
   The core file will only be produced if the EPIC_DEBUG #define is enabled
   in the source file config.h at compile time.  It is disabled by default.

Other Notes:
   Although it uses SAVE, this command will not clobber the .ircrc file,
   unless it happens to be the filename specified.
