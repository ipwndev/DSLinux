Synopsis:
   bind <key> meta1_character

Description:
   This function allows the user to access an alternate keymap.  When the
   key bound to this function is pressed, the next key pressed can be
   assigned a new meaning.  This allows for a sequence of keys to be bound
   to a function, such that only that combination of keys will execute
   the function.  This is how escape sequences are entered.

Aliases:
   META2, META3, and META5 through META19_CHARACTERs are identical
   in function as META1_CHARACTER.  META4_CHARACTER has some special
   characteristics described in its own help file.

See Also:
   bind(4) meta4_character

Restrictions:
   At most, key sequences may contain 2 keys.  For longer sequences (such
   as those required to control the arrow keys), one of the pair must be
   composed of 2 keys as well.
