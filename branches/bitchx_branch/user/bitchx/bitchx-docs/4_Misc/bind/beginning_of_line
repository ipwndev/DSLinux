Synopsis:
   bind <key> beginning_of_line

Description:
   This function moves the cursor to the beginning of the input line.
   This may be a position not currently visible on screen, due to the
   way the client wraps long input.  It has no visible effect when the
   cursor is already at the beginning of the input line.
