Synopsis:
   cd [<path>]

Description:
   This is used to change the current working directory.  If a path is
   specified, the client will try to change to that directory; else, it
   displays the current directory.  This is useful for other commands
   that deal with files but don't necessarily use absolute pathnames,
   such as EXEC, log files, or DCC file transfers.

See Also:
   which(4); which(6)

Other Notes:
   CD is smart enough to expand tildes (~) to the user's home directory.
