/** 
* A class for URL processing.
*
* The KURL class deals with uniform resource locators in a 
* protocol independent way. It works on file:-type URLs
* much like @ref QDir does on normal directories; but KURL extends 
* the directory operations to work on general URLs. In fact, the 
* part of KURL that only deals with syntax doesn't care about 
* the protocol at all, so feel free to use it to format any 
* URL-like string. 
* 
* NOTE: KURL doesn't support URL's that don't look like files 
* (for example mailto:someone@somewhere). [If URL's like this were OK, 
* there would be no reason for isMalformed() since any string with a 
* ":" would be a valid URL.  Comments please.] 
*
* First version by Torben Weis, redesigned by Steffen Hansen (stefh@mip.ou.dk),
* maintained by Torben Weis (weis@kde.org). Endcoding/Decoding done by
* Stephan Kulow (coolo@kde.org).
