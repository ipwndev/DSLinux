README.lib
----------

This README file is a placeholder for library files on your system. 
Under Microsoft Windows a successful build of all projects and
configurations will contain debug (fltkd.lib and fltkdlld.lib) and
release (fltk.lib fltkdll.lib) libraries for you to link to.  Both are
built using the multi-threaded settings.  The DLL files (fltkdll.dll
and fltkdlld.dll) required for a complete DLL-based binary distribution
are located in the "visualc" directory.

Under UNIX a single library file (libfltk.a, libfltk.sl, or libfltk.so)
will be built.
