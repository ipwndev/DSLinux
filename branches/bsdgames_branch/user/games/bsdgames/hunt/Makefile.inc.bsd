# System parameter flags are:
#	DEBUG		Don't trust everything in the code
#	INTERNET	Use the Internet domain IPC instead of UNIX domain
#	LOG		Use syslog error-logging in driver (needs SYSLOG_42 or
#			or SYSLOG_43)
#	OLDIPC		Use 4.1a internet system calls (must also define
#			INTERNET)
#	TERMINFO	Use terminfo instead of termcap
#	SYSLOG_42	Use 4.2 BSD syslog(3)
#	SYSLOG_43	Use 4.2 BSD syslog(3)
#	LOG		Use syslog(3) for logging errors
#	BSD_RELEASE	Which version of BSD distribution
#			42 is 4.2BSD (implies SYSLOG_42)
#			43 is 4.3BSD (implies BROADCAST, SYSLOG_43)
#	USE_CURSES	Use curses for everything (automatic w/TERMINFO)
#	SIGNAL_TYPE	void or int
