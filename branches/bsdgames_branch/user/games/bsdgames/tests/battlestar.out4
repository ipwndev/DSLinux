First Adventure game written by His Lordship, the honorable
Admiral D.W. Riggle


	This is a luxurious stateroom.
The floor is carpeted with a soft animal fur and the great wooden furniture
is inlaid with strips of platinum and gold.  Electronic equipment built
into the walls and ceiling is flashing wildly.  The floor shudders and
the sounds of dull explosions rumble though the room.  From a window in
the wall ahead comes a view of darkest space.  There is a small adjoining
room behind you, and a doorway right.

>-: 
	This is a walk in closet.
A wardrobe of immense magnitude greets the eye.  Furs and robes of kings
hang on rack after rack.  Silken gowns, capes woven with spun gold, and 
delicate synthetic fabrics are stowed here.  The bedroom is behind you.

A kingly robe of royal purple and spun gold is draped here.

	These are the executive suites of the battlestar.
Luxurious staterooms carpeted with crushed velvet and adorned with beaten
gold open onto this parlor. A wide staircase with ivory banisters leads
up or down. This parlor leads into a hallway left. The bridal suite is
right. Other rooms lie ahead and behind you.

>-: 
	This was once the first class lounge.
There is much rubble and destruction here that was not apparent elsewhere.
The walls and ceilings have broken in in some places. A staircase with
red coral banisters leads up. It is impossible to go left or right.
It seems a little clearer ahead.

There are some matches here.
