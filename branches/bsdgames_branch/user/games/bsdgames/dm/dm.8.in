.Sh NAME
.Nm dm
.Nd dungeon master
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ln
.Fl s Cm dm Ar game
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program used to regulate game playing.
.Nm
expects to be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to play.
This is done by creating symbolic links to
.Nm ,
in the directory
.Pa @gamesdir@
for all of the regulated games.
The actual binaries for these games should be placed in a
.Dq hidden
directory,
.Pa @libexecdir@ ,
that may only be accessed by the
.Nm
program.
.Nm
determines if the requested game is available and, if so, runs it.
The file
.Pa @dm_configfile@
controls the conditions under which games may be run.
.Pp
The file
.Pa @dm_nogamesfile@
may be used to
.Dq turn off
game playing.
If the file exists, no game playing is allowed; the contents of the file
will be displayed to any user requesting a game.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 tahoe .
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Two issues result from
.Nm
running the games setgid
.Dq games .
First, all games that allow users to run
.Ux
commands should carefully
set both the real and effective group ids immediately before executing
those commands.
Probably more important is that
.Nm
never be setgid anything but
.Dq games
so that compromising a game will result only in
the user's ability to play games at will.
Secondly, games which previously had no reason to run setgid and which
accessed user files may have to be modified.
