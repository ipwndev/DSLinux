# This is a run-time configuration example for the web browser retawq
# (<http://retawq.sourceforge.net/>).
#
# To make use of it, enter commands like the following:
# - mkdir /home/your_home/.retawq/
# - cp example-config /home/your_home/.retawq/config
# After that, edit the new file.
#
# Note that this file contains alternative variants for some sections (marked
# with "OR:"); in a real config file, each section should appear at most once,
# so you'll have to remove (or combine) parts of this exemplary file if you
# actually want to use it. If you don't need/like a setting, you can just
# leave it out; retawq then applies a default behavior.
#
# Also note that some of these options only work if the respective compile-time
# configuration options have been enabled (cf. retawq/docu/ctconfig.html), some
# of which are disabled by default. You might get warning messages otherwise.
#
# All run-time configuration options are explained in the documentation file
# retawq/docu/rtconfig.html.


# Options Part I: User Interface

# A bookmarks document; we use a local file:
bookmarks local:~/bookmarks.html

# We don't like colors:
colors off

# OR: we want black-on-white colors:
colors reverse

# We are experts and don't wanna be asked for confirmation of certain
# "dangerous" commands:
dont-confirm quit close overwrite form-submit

# We want to execute a normal shell program with the keyboard command "!":
execext-shell /bin/sh -c

# Our home page:
home http://my-domain.org/

# OR: nah, we don't have a home page, and the keyboard command "h" shall not
# have any effect:
home off

# Jump shortcuts with "constant" URLs; we use three search engines and two home
# pages, so the keyboard commands "e" and "h" wouldn't be enough:
jumps:
 s1 www.foo-search.com
 s2 http://www.bar-search.com/
 s3 www.baz-search.com:42/cgi-bin/special-search.cgi
 h1 www.my-private-home.name
 h2 www.home-of-employer.com
 0 local:~/nothing.html
 3la local:/usr/three-letter-acronyms/
 help local:/usr/local/doc/retawq/index.html

# OR: an example with a URL _pattern_ for a search engine which allows to
# specify the search string within the URL (technobabble: the search engine
# uses the "GET" method for form submission, not the "POST" method):
jumps:
 s http://www.foo-search.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?what=!1&matchnum=42 !1
# When you enter "s blah" with the keyboard command "j" then, retawq replaces
# the marker "!1" with "blah" and thus opens the URL
# http://www.foo-search.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?what=blah&matchnum=42
# which could result in a match list from the search engine that contains up to
# 42 entries without the need to use the search engine's HTML form. - The
# actual URL pattern depends on the search engine you use, of course; this is
# just a fictitious example.

# A keymap list for mapping some keys to command actions; for simplicity, the
# following rules show some default mappings as documented in docu/key.html and
# docu/keymap.html; this example shall just give an idea how this option could
# be used:
keymap command
 Q quit
 l line-down
 r document-reload
 home document-top
 cursor-left view-back

# A keymap list for mapping keys to line input mode actions; for simplicity,
# the following rules show some default mappings as documented in docu/key.html
# and docu/keymap.html; this example shall just give an idea how this option
# could be used:
keymap line-input
 cursor-left to-left
 cursor-up to-start
 ctrl-a area-switch

# Sorting options for local directory listings:
local-dir-sort
 /bin/* S # list larger programs first ("s" = "size"; uppercase = descending)
 /home/my_home/* tn # list directories before files and sort by name otherwise
 * n # sort by name ("n" = "name"; rule superfluous - retawq's default)

# Don't want scroll bars; currently this is only relevant for OPTION_TG=xcurses
scroll-bars off

# Our favorite search engine:
search-engine http://www.foo-search.com/

# Set the terminal window title
termwintitle 1


# Options Part II: Technical

# FTP login; we use a rather silly configuration example here, just to show
# what's possible.
ftp-login
 anonymous true-address@my-domain.org *.org:21 # for any .org server, port 21
 pub fake-address@foo.org ftp.stupid-server.com:7077 # for explicit server/port
 anonymous fake@foo.org *.com # for any .com server, any port
 anonymous guest * # (rule superfluous - retawq's default)

# OR: FTP login; if you get "login failed" messages when you try to access
# public FTP servers, use a default rule like the following:
ftp-login
 anonymous mail-address@foo.org *

# ftps TLS negotiation method
ftps-method
 ftp.foo.org authtls-dataclear # use TLS only for commands, not for data
 bar.baz.org autodetect # bar.baz.org has a good server program...
 *.baz.org authtls-dataclear # ...but other servers there are less smart

# HTTP cookies
http-cookies
 allow foo.org # we need cookies for an important service on this server
 deny * # deny everything else (rule superfluous - retawq's default)

# OR: we love cookies and want'em all (deprecated)
http-cookies
 allow *

# HTTP proxy configuration; we use a rather silly configuration example here,
# just to show what's possible.
http-proxies
 none *my-domain.org # no proxy for servers in my-domain.org (local network)
 firewall.my-domain.org *linux.org # proxy for any port on linux.org servers
 my-cache.my-domain.org *.org:80 # proxy for port 80 on any other .org servers
 my-proxy.foo.org:42 *.com # proxy for .com servers
 none * # no proxy for any other server (rule superfluous - retawq's default)

# define HTTP protocol versions for certain servers
http-version
 foo.org 1.1 # foo.org uses a good server program, so let's try HTTP/1.1

# When downloading something from an HTTP server, we prefer the French
# language, but would also accept English; note that there must not be
# whitespace between the single languages.
languages fr,en

# local CGI scripts
local-cgi
 allow /usr/cgi-bin/special-script.cgi # only allow this specific script
 deny * # deny everything else (rule superfluous - retawq's default)

# OR: local CGI scripts - more permissive
local-cgi
 allow /usr/cgi-bin/* # allow any ("*") scripts in this directory

# default server for "news:" and "nntp:" URLs
news-server-default news.foo.org

# Maximum number of automatic redirections; we need to access a completely
# screwed server which requires more than 10 redirections.
redirections 15

# Tell HTTP servers about our operating system
user-agent 1
