<p>virtual window, virtual view: many text browsers allow their users to work
with only one document (e.g. web page) at a time. retawq tries to break this
uncomfortable, unnecessarily restrictive condition by offering users to create
and use as many "virtual windows" as they like and arbitrarily long chains of
"virtual views" in each window. This is similar to the handling in graphical
browsers with their "New Window", "Back" and "Forward" operations. The windows
and views in retawq are called "virtual" because at most two of them are
visible at any time and because they don't have those nifty buttons etc. of
"real", graphical windows.</p>

<p>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier; this is the formally correct term, so it
is used in the source code and developer documentation; but all of retawq's
user documentation and user interface texts use the notion "URL" or "link"
instead because most users hardly know the notion "URI".</p>

<p>URL: Uniform Resource Location</p>

<p>URN: Uniform Resource Name</p>

<p>Request: this term is used for different kinds of requests: 1. a request
from the user interface to the resource manager, as encoded in a
tResourceRequest structure; 2. a request from the whole program ("the network
client", represented by the resource manager) to a "network server" (or proxy)
via TCP stream sockets (or pipes, for local CGI scripts), consisting of one
command (e.g. for HTTP) or a sequence of commands (e.g. for FTP).</p>

<p>Session: there are two kinds of sessions - <a href="tls.html">TLS/SSL
sessions</a> and <a href="session.html">others</a>...</p>
