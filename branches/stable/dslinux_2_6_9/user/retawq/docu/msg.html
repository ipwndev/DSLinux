<p>As mentioned in the <a href="user_guide.html">user guide</a>, the bottom
line of the screen might be used to display messages. This documentation page
details a few of them and suggests solutions for errors.</p>

<p><a name="normsg"></a><b>Normal Messages</b></p>

<p>"Saving": you started saving something in a local file, and no error
occurred so far; the message won't disappear by itself, so don't wait for this
to happen; unless you save a very big chunk at once (say, more than one
megabyte) or on a very slow medium, you can just continue your work
immediately.</p>

<p><a name="errmsg"></a><b>Error Messages</b></p>

<p>"Keyboard command not handled": you pressed a key which represents a <a
href="key.html">keyboard command</a>, but it wasn't handled because you used it
in the wrong "context", e.g. for the wrong <a href="wk.html">window
kind</a>.</p>
<p>"Key not handled": you pressed a key which doesn't represent a <a
href="key.html">keyboard command</a> and also can't be handled in any other way
in the given situation.</p>
<p>"This element is disabled": you tried to use an element of an HTML form, but
the element has been disabled by the web page author and presumably shouldn't
be used; if you want to use it anyway, apply the <a href="key.html">keyboard
command</a> "E".</p>
<p>"Redirection problem": there are basically the following kinds of problems.
1. Too many automatic redirections occur in a row; you might be able to solve
this problem by setting the <a href="rtconfig.html">run-time configuration
option</a> "redirections" to a high value. 2. A server tries to redirect retawq
to the same URL which was originally accessed; this would cause an infinite
loop of redirections.</p>
<p>"Feature ... was disabled at compile-time", "Scheme/protocol disabled":
retawq might "generally" be able to do what you tried, but the respective <a
href="ctconfig.html">compile-time configuration option</a> was disabled. To
solve this problem, rebuild the program with the option enabled and try
again.</p>
<p>"Can't lookup hostname": the libraries on your computer were unable to
transform a server hostname to a numerical IP (Internet Protocol) address. The
most likely reason is that the hostname contains a slight typographical error -
check the name. Or maybe your DNS (Domain Name System) database nameservers are
currently down or temporarily "forgot" the hostname due to technical problems -
try again later. Depending on the networking setup of your computer, you might
try to change the nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf (but do this only if you know
what you do).</p>
<p>"Connection refused": you tried to access a server/portnumber where no
server program is "listening"; maybe the server is currently "too busy" or down
for maintenance or due to a crash, try again later; or maybe you used a service
(e.g. wrong portnumber) which is never offered by the server.</p>
<p>"Server response invalid": the server sent a "syntactically malformed"
response. This might happen due to server bugs, or maybe you tried to access
e.g. an FTP service on an HTTP portnumber.</p>
<p>"Server closed connection", "Connection reset by peer": the server program
seems to have closed the connection prematurely, or a problem occurred
somewhere in the network; try again if you think that you e.g. didn't receive a
complete document.</p>
<p>"TLS-related error": you tried to access a URL using <a
href="tls.html">TLS/SSL</a>, but e.g. the library couldn't be initialized
(maybe it wasn't installed/configured correctly) or the TLS handshake failed.
In many cases, further error information is presented in the message line,
especially when you use the GnuTLS library; for example: "ciphers" can mean
that client and server couldn't negotiate a common cryptographic algorithm
(maybe it helps if you enable more ciphers in the library); "packet" means that
a malformed or unexpected packet was received (might be a server or library
bug; or maybe you tried to access an "ftps" service on an "ftp" portnumber,
e.g. because you used the TLS method specifier "tls" with the <a
href="rtconfig.html">run-time configuration option</a> "ftps-method" for the
wrong server or portnumber); "handshake" means that the TLS handshake didn't
succeed (maybe due to a TLS packet of an unexpected kind).</p>
<p>"Forbidden by configuration": you tried to do something which has not been
explicitly allowed in the <a href="rtconfig.html">run-time configuration</a>.
This might occur when you try to do something which might cause security
problems, e.g. the execution of a local CGI script.</p>
<p>"Hostname missing": you entered a URL which 1. doesn't contain a hostname
but 2. uses a <a href="scheme.html">scheme</a> which requires a hostname. To
solve this problem with the schemes "news"/"nntp", you can use the <a
href="rtconfig.html">run-time configuration option</a> "news-server-default";
for other schemes, correct the URL and try again.</p>
<p>"Can't execute program": you tried to execute a program (e.g. a local CGI
script) from within retawq, but this failed; check whether you actually have
the necessary filesystem permissions for execution of the program and whether
you can launch it from a shell.</p>
