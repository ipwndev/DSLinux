# Should add dates from years before 1998.

# Test dates from Astronomical Almanac 1998, rounded to nearest hour.
# We should also test the fraction illuminated given by the program,
# but the Astronomical Almanac 1998 only gives these figures to 2
# decimal places (like pom) so I don't know which are border cases and
# which are good tests.
