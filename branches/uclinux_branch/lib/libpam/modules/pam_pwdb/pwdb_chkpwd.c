 * This program is designed to run setuid(root) or with sufficient
 * privilege to read all of the unix password databases. It is designed
 * to provide a mechanism for the current user (defined by this
 * process' real uid) to verify their own password.
 *
 * The password is read from the standard input. The exit status of
 * this program indicates whether the user is authenticated or not.
