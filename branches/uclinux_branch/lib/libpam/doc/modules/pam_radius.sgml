<sect2>Overview of module

<p>
This module is intended to provide the session service for users
authenticated with a RADIUS server.  At the present stage, the only
option supported is the use of the RADIUS server as an accounting
server.

<tag><bf>Description:</bf></tag>

This module is intended to provide the session service for users
authenticated with a RADIUS server. At the present stage, the only
option supported is the use of the RADIUS server as an <em/accounting/
server.  

<p>
(There are few things which needs to be cleared out first in
the PAM project until one will be able to use this module and expect
it to magically start pppd in response to a RADIUS server command to
use PPP for this user, or to initiate a telnet connection to another
host, or to hang and call back the user using parameters provided in
the RADIUS server response. Most of these things are better suited for
the radius login application. I hope to make available Real Soon (tm)
patches for the login apps to make it work this way.)

<p>
When opening a session, this module sends an ``Accounting-Start''
message to the RADIUS server, which will log/update/whatever a
database for this user. On close, an ``Accounting-Stop'' message is
sent to the RADIUS server.

<p>
This module has no other prerequisites for making it work.  One can
install a RADIUS server just for fun and use it as a centralized
accounting server and forget about wtmp/last/sac etc. .

<tag><bf>Examples/suggested usage:</bf></tag>

For the services that need this module (<em/login/ for example) put
the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt> as the last line for that
service (usually after the pam_unix session line):
<tscreen>
<verb>
login	session	 required	pam_radius.so
</verb>
</tscreen>
Replace <tt/login/ for each service you are using this module.

<p>
This module make extensive use of the API provided in libpwdb
0.54preB or later. By default, it will read the radius server
configuration (hostname and secret) from <tt>/etc/raddb/server</tt>.
This is a default compiled into libpwdb, and curently there is no way to
modify this default without recompiling libpwdb. I am working on
extending the radius support from libpwdb to provide a possibility
to make this runtime-configurable.

Also please note that libpwdb will require also the RADIUS
dictionary to be present (<tt>/etc/raddb/dictionary</tt>).
