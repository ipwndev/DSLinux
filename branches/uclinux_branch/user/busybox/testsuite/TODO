This testsuite is quite obviously a work in progress.  As such,
there are a number of good extensions.  If you are looking for
something to do, feel free to tackle one or more of the following:

Buildroot support
	Erik has put together a handy package for constructing and
	testing busybox called buildroot.  Integrating this into
	the testsuite would allow for greater test coverage (e.g.,
	init, mount, and other privileged applications).

libbb unit testing
	Being able to test the functions of libbb individually may
	help to prevent regressions.

Standardization
	This testsuite is totally bastardized.  It would be better
	to use an existing test framework, such as dejagnu, greg,
	or a XUnit clone (shunit?).
