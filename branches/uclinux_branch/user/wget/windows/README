To build Wget with VC++ run configure.bat (in the main wget directory), 
and then run nmake. At a certain point in time wget exposed some 
compiler bugs in VC++ 5.0; VC++ 6.0 sp 5 is known to be safe. However 
read the rest of this document before continuing.

For VC++ the current default is to configure wget with ssl support; 
first get openssl (http://www.openssl.org), compile it and install 
relevant headers and libraries where your compiler can find them; 
currently this could mean (presuming default installation directories) 
copy (from the compiled openssl dirctory) the whole inc32/openssl 
directory and its contents to 
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\openssl",
and from out32dll (in the openssl directory) the two needed libraries 
(libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib) to 
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\lib".
These locations aren't exactly the best but will get you started if you 
don't know where to place these headers and libraries.
Usually at runtime some openssl libraries (currently ssleay32.dll and
libeay32.dll) will need to be available in your environment PATH.

If you want to build the help file you will need a copy of makeinfo to
convert wget.texi to rtf and html. I've made a copy available at
<URL:ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/wget/makeinfo.zip>.  This copy of
makeinfo is from the miktxt 1.10 archive available from ctan. You also
will need perl 5, one possibility is Activeperl (currently free) from
<URL:http://www.activestate.com>; you need to locate the download and
install instructions for the current version available (since the
packages and installation instructions change from time to time).

If you don't want/can't to compile wget with openssl comment the SSL 
related lines in windows\Makefile.src; then follow the normal 
instructions (configure.bat and so on).
