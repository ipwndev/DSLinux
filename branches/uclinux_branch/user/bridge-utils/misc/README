bidi.c		A quick-and-dirty hack that allows you to 'connect'
		multiple file descriptors together (everything
		received on one fd will be sent out to all the other
		fds). Works great for tying ethertaps together (for
		testing stp protocol interaction et al.).

		The command-line arguments are the names of the
		ethertaps to be connected together.
