.TH "RARPD" "8" "27 September 2002" "iputils-020927" "System Manager's Manual: iputils"
.SH NAME
rarpd \- answer RARP REQUESTs
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBarping\fR [ \fB-aAvde\fR]  [ \fB-b \fIbootdir\fB\fR]  [ \fB\fIinterface\fB\fR] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Listens
RARP
requests from clients. Provided MAC address of client
is found in \fI/etc/ethers\fR database and
obtained host name is resolvable to an IP address appropriate
for attached network, \fBrarpd\fR answers to client with RARPD
reply carrying an IP address.
.PP
To allow multiple boot servers on the network \fBrarpd\fR
optionally checks for presence Sun-like bootable image in TFTP directory.
It should have form \fBHexadecimal_IP.ARCH\fR, f.e. to load
sparc 193.233.7.98 \fIC1E90762.SUN4M\fR is linked to
an image appropriate for SUM4M in directory \fI/etc/tftpboot\fR.
.SH "WARNING"
.PP
This facility is deeply obsoleted by
BOOTP
and later
DHCP protocols.
However, some clients really still need this to boot.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Listen on all the interfaces. Currently it is an internal
option, its function is overridden with \fIinterface\fR
argument. It should not be used.
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Listen not only RARP but also ARP messages, some rare clients
use ARP by some unknown reason.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Be verbose.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Debug mode. Do not go to background.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
Do not check for presence of a boot image, reply if MAC address
resolves to a valid IP address using \fI/etc/ethers\fR
database and DNS. 
.TP
\fB-b \fIbootdir\fB\fR
TFTP boot directory. Default is \fI/etc/tftpboot\fR
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

\fBtftpd\fR(8).
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR was written by
Alexey Kuznetsov
<kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability
to listen and send RARP and ARP packets. It also needs CAP_NET_ADMIN
to give to kernel hint for ARP resolution; this is not strictly required,
but some (most of, to be more exact) clients are so badly broken that
are not able to answer ARP before they are finally booted. This is
not wonderful taking into account that clients using RARPD in 2002
are all unsupported relic creatures of 90's and even earlier.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR is part of \fIiputils\fR package
and the latest versions are  available in source form for anonymous ftp
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz.
