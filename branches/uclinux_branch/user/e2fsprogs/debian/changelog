e2fsprogs (1.24a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release (Closes: #109577).
  ** The only new code in there is in codepaths that
    are only visited when previously unsupported features are used, so
    they add virtually no risk.  Support for raw image files will be of
    great help to debug users' problems.  Urgency set to "high" to make
    sure this version gets released with woody.
  
  ** Fsck prints a warning message if now valid filesystems are passed to
    it. (Closes: #107458).
  ** Fsck -A will not try to interpret device names for filesystems which
    have a pass number is 0. (Closes: #106696).
  ** If -O none is passed to mke2fs, it will now not set the sparse_super
    feature (Closes: #108165).
  ** Tune2fs has been fixed to make sure that only error messages go to
    stderr, and normal message go to stdout (Closes: #108555).
  ** Minor man pages updates (Closes: #30833, #108174).
  ** Doc fixes (Closes: #110621).

  * Added latest patch from Ted for autodetection of llseek() proto.
  * Switched to libc6, without libc5 compatibility (yet ?).
  * Turned Pre-Depends into Depends to allow installation. Dirty
    though. But what were Pre-Depends for anyway ?

e2fsprogs (1.10-7) unstable; urgency=HIGH

e2fsprogs (1.10-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Official libc6 patches from Ted.
  * Converted to debstd - let it do the stripping stuff.
  * Separated libcomerr into a standalone lib - includes full doc and tools.
  * Separated development files into e2fslibs-dev, which Provides the 4 other
    -dev packages.
  * Now Provides the 4 other lib packages, to make it possible not to depend
    upon e2fsprogs itself. These libs WILL be taken out of "progs" in the
    next release.
