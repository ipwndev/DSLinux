.TH UUID_TIME 3 "@E2FSPROGS_MONTH@ @E2FSPROGS_YEAR@" "E2fsprogs version @E2FSPROGS_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
uuid_time \- extract the time at which the UUID was created
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <uuid/uuid.h>
.sp
.BI "time_t uuid_time(uuid_t " uu ", struct timeval *" ret_tv )
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uuid_time
function extracts the time at which the supplied UUID
.I uu
was created.  Note that the UUID creation time is encoded within the UUID,
and this function can only reasonably expect to extract the creation time
for UUIDs created with the
.BR uuid_generate (3)
function.  It may or may not work with UUIDs created by OSF DCE
.BR uuidgen .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
The time at which the UUID was created, in seconds since January 1, 1970 GMT
(the epoch), is returned (see
.BR time "(2))."
The time at which the UUID was created, in seconds and microseconds since
the epoch, is also stored in the location pointed to by
.I ret_tv
(see
.BR gettimeofday "(2))."
