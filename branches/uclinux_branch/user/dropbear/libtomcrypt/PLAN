The following functions are marked for removal and/or behavioural change by v1.00 of LibTomCrypt

1.  RSA Support

      rsa_pad, rsa_signpad, rsa_depad, rsa_signdepad, rsa_import, rsa_export

They will be replaced with PKCS #1 compliant OAEP/PSS padding function as early as v0.96

2.  DSA Support

      dsa_import, dsa_export

Will be replaced with suitable DSS [what is the standard?] compliant formats.  Planned for v0.96

3.  Key Ring Support
  
      (all)

The entire API will be dropped as early as v0.96.  It was just an experiment and nobody uses it anyways.

4.  Test Harness
 
      demos/test.c

The test harness is well overdue for a makeover.  Planned for as early as v0.97


Put things in order...

v0.96  -- removed keyring.c and gf.c
       -- removed LTC RSA padding
       -- DSS support [whatever this entails]
       -- Bug fixes/updates to the PKCS/DSS support, should be stable in this release

v0.97  -- Re-written test harness
       -- More demos in the manual and demos/ directory

... future???
