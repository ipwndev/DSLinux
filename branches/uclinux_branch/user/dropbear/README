This is Dropbear, a smallish SSH 2 server.

INSTALL has compilation instructions.

MULTI has instructions on making a multi-purpose binary (ie a single binary
which performs multiple tasks, to save disk space)

SMALL has some tips on creating small binaries.

See TODO for a few of the things I know need looking at, and please contact
me if you have any questions/bugs found/features/ideas/comments etc :)
