/* SIG_NAME:
 *	This symbol contains a list of signal names in order of

 *	to be used as a static array initialization, like this:
 *		char *sig_name[] = { SIG_NAME };
 *	The signals in the list are separated with commas, and each signal
 *	is surrounded by double quotes. There is no leading SIG in the signal
 *	name, i.e. SIGQUIT is known as "QUIT".
 *	Gaps in the signal numbers (up to NSIG) are filled in with NUMnn,
 *	etc., where nn is the actual signal number (e.g. NUM37).
 *	The signal number for sig_name[i] is stored in sig_num[i].
 *	The last element is 0 to terminate the list with a NULL.  This
 *	corresponds to the 0 at the end of the sig_num list.

/* SIG_NUM:
 *	This symbol contains a list of signal numbers, in the same order as the
 *	SIG_NAME list. It is suitable for static array initialization, as in:
 *		int sig_num[] = { SIG_NUM };
 *	The signals in the list are separated with commas, and the indices
 *	within that list and the SIG_NAME list match, so it's easy to compute
 *	the signal name from a number or vice versa at the price of a small
 *	dynamic linear lookup. 
 *	Duplicates are allowed, but are moved to the end of the list.
 *	The signal number corresponding to sig_name[i] is sig_number[i].
 *	if (i < NSIG) then sig_number[i] == i.  
 *	The last element is 0, corresponding to the 0 at the end of
 *	the sig_name list.
