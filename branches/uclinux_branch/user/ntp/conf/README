README file for directory ./conf of the NTP Version 4 distribution

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP Version 4 daemon ntpd. These files illustrate some of the more
obtuse configurations you may run into. They are not likely to do
anything good if run on machines other than their native spot, so don't
just blindly copy something and put it up. Additional information can
be found in the ./doc directory of the base directory.

See the Config.local.dist file in the base directory for an explanation
of the defines used.

The files Config.* are used to generate fullblown binaries suitable for
distribution with the systems shown as suffix. While this can result
in some degree of useless code, the degree is small compared to the
size of the baseline code. The files *.conf are representative NTP
run-time configuration files, which normally live in /etc/ntp.conf.
