# This illustrates the use of an external clock with the local clock
# driver, as well as a multicast server. The prefer keyword on the
# local clock driver declares an external clock and that the time of
# this server should not be wiggled by an NTP peer, unless the
# external source comes unstuck. Note the use of the multicast group
# ID assigned to NTP, 224.0.1.1, which identifies this as a multicast
# server rather than a broadcast one. The other NTP peers are known
# stratum-1 chimes intended as backup should the external clock croak.
