.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The 
.B Nessus Security Scanner
is a security auditing tool made up of two parts: a server, and a client.
The server,
.BR nessusd (8)
is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client
.B nessus
provides an interface to the user.  It comes in two flavours, with and
without GUI (grephical user interface) support.
.LP
As an X11 client,
.B Nessus 
is based on the Gimp ToolKit (GTK) and needs no arguments upon
start up.
.LP
As a command line version,
.B Nessus 
always needs the following arguments placed after the options:

.sp
.I Server
.br
.in +5
is the address, or the host name of the 
.B Nessusd
server host to connect to,
.in -5
.sp
.I Port
.br
.in +5
is the port, the nessus server lisens on for connect requests,
.in -5
.sp
.I Login
.br
.in +5
is the user login name that is to be used for connecting to the 
.B Nessusd
server,
.in -5
.sp
.I Trgfile
.br
.in +5
is the name of a file containing the lists of targets host adresses,
or names that are to be checked or scanned,
.in -5
.sp
.I Resultsfile
.br
.in +5
is the name of a file where the 
.B Nessus
client will stored the scan results at the end of the test.
.in -5
.LP
In that sense,
.B Nessus
will always adopt a command line behaviour if there are any
command line arguments which are not detectes ad options, i.e. they do
not begin with a dash '\fB-\fP'.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v, --version
shows version number and quits
.TP
.B -h, --help
lists the available options
.TP
.B -n, --no-pixmaps
no pixmaps. Handy if you are running nessus on a remote computer as
it reduces bandwidth.
.TP
.BI -k\  <key-len> ,\ --set-key-length =<key-len>
Enforce a minimum key length different from the default 1024.
.TP
.BI -T\  <type>, \ --output-type =<type>
Save the data as <type>, where <type> can be 'html', 'html_graph', 'text', 'tex' 
or 'nsr'
.TP
.TP
.B -q, --batch-mode 
force quiet, or batch mode.  Setting this option, the nessus client
always expects the options for the batch mode, following.
.TP
.BI -r\  <report-file> ,\ --open-report= <report-file>
Using the gui, 
.B Nessus
visualizes a report file from a previous session.   Repeating this
option, more files are displayed.

.SH KEY MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
.LP
The key management options can be used while another instance of
.B nessus
is already running. Modifications on the key data base
will be honoured by the running instance. If
.B nessus
was invoked with a key manangement option, it will not start
up as deamon. 
.TP
.B -C, --change-pass-phrase
Let 
.B nessus
secure the private key by a personal pass phrase.  Using this feature,
a pass phrase is read from the command line (see \fBgetpass\fP(1) for
details upon the input device) which is consequently used to encrypt
that key.  Upon restart,
.B nessus
will not come up until you have entered the correct pass phrase.
Once, the
pass phrase is lost you can only delete the private key (usually in
$HOME/.nessus.keys.)
.sp
In order to remove the pass phrase from a key, you need to give
an empty pass phrase.
.TP
.B -L, --list-keys
List the entries in the user key data base.
.TP
.BI \-K\  <delete-key>, --delete-key= <delete-key>
Delete a key from user the data base.
.TP
.BI -X\  <key-file> ,\ --export-pubkey =<key-file>
Export the public user key into the argument file \fI<key-file>\fP.
If the key tag exists, already in the file and the key is the same
as the current one, nothing is done.  If the key tag is found with
a different key, an error is printed. Otherwise the key is appended
to the file.
.sp
If the argument \fI<key-file>\fP is a dash \fB-\fP, the current key is
printed to stdout.

.SH X11 USER INTERFACE
.LP
The  nessus client interface is divided in several panels:
.TP
.IB The " nessusd host " section
In this section, you must enter the nessusd host to connect to, as well as the
port. You must also enter your 
.B nessusd 
user name and your password (not the one of the system). Once you are done, you
must click on the 'login now!' button, which will establish the connection
the the nessusd host.
.br
Once the connection is established, 
.B nessusd
sends to the client the list of attacks it will perform, as well as the
default preferences to use.
.TP
.IB The " target selection " section
In this section, you are required to enter the primary target. A
primary target may be a single host (like prof.fr.nessus.org), an IP
(192.168.1.1), a subnet (192.168.1.1/24, or prof.fr.nessus.org), or a
list of hosts, separated by commas (like : 192.168.1.1,
192.168.2.1/24, prof.fr.nessus.org, joyeux.fr.nessus.org).
.sp
You can restrict the maximum number of hosts to test using the	
.I Max Hosts
entry. This is an
.I extra security
 which will garantee you that you will not test other by accident
(for instance, if you only plan to test prof.fr.nessus.org and
www.fr.nessus.org, you can safely set this entry to 
.IR 2 ).
.sp
This panel also allows you to enable the
.I Perform a DNS zone transfer
option. This option is dangerous and should be enabled with caution. 
For instance, if you want to test www.nessus.org, then if this option
is set, nessusd will attempt to get the list of the hosts in the
.I nessus.org
domain.
.sp
The latter option may be dangerous. For instance, if you enable it and
you ask to test 192.168.1.1/24, then nessusd will do a reverse lookup on
.I every
IP, and will attempt a DNS zone transfer on every domain. That is, if 
192.168.1.1 is www.foo.bar, and 192.168.1.10 is mail.bar.foo, then
a DNS zone transfer will be made on the domains
.IR foo.bar and bar.foo . 
.TP
.B The Plugins section
Once you have successfully logged into the remote nessusd server,
this section is filed with the list of the attacks that the server will
perform. This panel is divided in two parts : the plugins families, and
the plugins themselves. If you click on the name of a plugin, then
a dialog will appear, showing you which will be the error message
sent by the plugin if the attack is successful.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B NESSUSUSER
If this environemt variable is set, the name specified by this
variable is considered as login name and used for tagging/identifying
the personal key.
.TP
.B NESSUSHOME
If the environemt variable is set, this path is used instead of the
path defined	by the \fBHOME\fP variable.  This path is referred to
as \fB~/\fP, below.
.TP
.B userprofile
Ignored on non-Windows machines, this variable takes precedence
over HOME, which has the same meaning in the given context.
.TP
.B HOME
The path to the user's home directory which will hold the client
configuration cache \fI.nessusrc\fP and the key data base
\&\fI.nessus.keys\fP (see below.)  The path is referred to as \fB~/\fP,
below.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B ~/.nessusrc 
is the client configuration cache, which contains the options about,
which nessusd server to connect to by default, which plugins to
activate, and so on.  The file is created automatically within the
first 
.BR nessus ( 1 )
session.
.TP
.B ~/.nessus.keys 
contains the client private key, as well as the nessusd servers public
keys.  This file is created automatically when starting
.BR nessus ( 1 ).
