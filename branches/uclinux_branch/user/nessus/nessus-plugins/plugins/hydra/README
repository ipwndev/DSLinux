INTRODUCTION
------------
Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password
security study shows.
This tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security
consultants the possiblity to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized
access from remote to a system.
THIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY!
FOR USING THIS TOOL COMMERCIALLY, SEE THE LICENCE FILE!

There are already several login hacker tools available, however none does
either support more than one protocol to attack or support parallized
connects.
Currently this tool supports:
TELNET, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, LDAP, SMB, REXEC, SOCKS5, VNC, POP3, IMAP, NNTP,
PCNFS, ICQ, Cisco auth, Cisco enable.
However the module engine for new services is very easy so it won't take a
long time until even more services are supported.
Planned are: SSH v1+v2, Oracle, MS-SQL and more.
Additionally, password only protocols will be supported in the future:
SNMP, RIP, OSPF and others.


HOW TO USE
----------
Type "make" to compile hydra and then "./hydra -h" to see the commandline
options. You make also type "make install" to install hydra to /usr/local/bin.
Note that NO login/password file is included yet. Generate one yourself.


SPEED
-----
through the parallizing feature, this password cracker tool can be very
fast, however it depends on the protocol. The fastest is generally POP3,
then FTP, then Telnet, and the least IMAP.
Experiment with the task option (-t) to speed thinks up! The higher - the
faster ;-) (but too high, and it disables the service)
To prevent disabling you can now use the -g option for "slow-starts".


STATISTICS
----------
Run against a SuSE Linux 7.2 on localhost with a "-C FILE" containing
295 entries (294 tries invalid logins, 1 valid). Every test was run three
times (only for "1 task" just once), and the average noted down.

			P A R A L L E L    T A S K S
SERVICE	1	4	8	16	32	50	64	100	128

telnet	23:20	5:58	2:58	1:34	1:05	0:33	0:45*	0:25*	0:55*

imap	31:05	7:41	3:51	1:58	1:01	0:39	0:32	0:25	0:21

(*)
Note: telnet timings can be VERY different for 64 to 128 tasks! e.g. with
128 tasks, running four times resulted in timings between 28 and 97 seconds!
The reason for this is unknown...

guesses per task (rounded up):
	295	74	38	19	10	6	5	3	3

guesses possible per connect (depends on the server software and config):
	telnet	4
	ftp	6
	pop3	1
	imap	3
