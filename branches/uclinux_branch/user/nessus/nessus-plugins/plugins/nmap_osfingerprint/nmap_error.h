 *  Source is provided to this software because we believe users have  *

 *                                                                     *
 *  Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix     *
 *  bugs, and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send     *
 *  your changes to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation     *
 *  into the main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or *
 *  one the insecure.org development mailing lists, it is assumed that *
 *  you are offering Fyodor the unlimited, non-exclusive right to      *
 *  reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  This is important because  *
 *  the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems    *
 *  for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  Nmap     *
 *  will always be available Open Source.  If you wish to specify      *
 *  special license conditions of your contributions, just say so      *
 *  when you send them.                                                *
