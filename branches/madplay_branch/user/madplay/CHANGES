===============================================================================

Version 0.15.2 (beta)

  * Applied a minor patch from Florin Braescu for the ALSA audio output
    module.

  * Modified the reading of LAME encoder tags to compensate for Replay Gain
    heresy by subtracting 6 dB from Replay Gain values written by LAME
    3.95.1 and later. This achieves a uniform reference of 83 dB SPL in
    accordance with the Replay Gain proposed standard.

  * Updated the display of encoder tags to show the Replay Gain reference
    level.

  * Updated documentation to mention the Replay Gain reference level and
    LAME heresy.

Version 0.15.1 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.59, automake 1.8.2, libtool 1.5.2, gettext 0.14.1.

  * Added support for Replay Gain to `madplay', enabled with a new -G
    (--replay-gain) option.

  * Added new -T (--show-tags-only) option to `madplay' to display ID3
    and/or encoder tags without decoding any audio.

  * Renamed `id3tag' command-line program to `madtag' to avoid conflict with
    another package.

  * Improved 32-bit support detection for audio_oss module.

  * Fixed a problem using the --disable-mmap configure option.

Version 0.15.0 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.57, automake 1.7.5, libtool 1.4.3, gettext 0.11.5.

  * Added support to `madplay' for arbitrary resampling ratios.

  * Added new -R (--sample-rate) option to `madplay'.

  * Added support to `madplay' for RVA2 (relative volume adjustment) frames
    in ID3 tags. The "master volume" channel volume adjustment of the first
    RVA2 frame is now honored, unless overridden by a command-line option.

  * Added new -A (--adjust-volume) option to `madplay' to override per-file
    relative volume adjustments (see above).

  * Added new keyboard controls to `madplay' for dynamically increasing (+)
    and decreasing (-) the audio output gain.

  * Changed `madplay' tty controls to be disabled by default when -q or -Q
    is given (on the assumption these are most often used when running
    madplay in the background.)

  * Added new --display-time option to `madplay'.

  * Changed `madplay' to allow switching to Overall Time even for singleton
    playlists.

  * Added new --ancillary-output option to `madplay'.

  * Added new audio_qnx module (untested) for QNX platforms courtesy of
    Steven Grimm.

  * Added new audio_alsa module (untested) for ALSA platforms courtesy of
    Hod McWuff.

  * Added new audio_carbon module for Mac OS X platforms.

  * Changed audio_sun to use the AUDIODEV environment variable for the
    default audio device path.

  * Changed audio_hex support to be enabled in all builds.

  * Changed to use native Cygwin build by default; give --host=mingw32 to
    `configure' to use MinGW (and avoid a dependency on the Cygwin DLL).

  * Begun work on a new `id3tag' command-line tool for displaying and
    manipulating ID3 tags.

Version 0.14.2 (beta)

  * Added a new output module, audio_esd, for EsounD (Enlightened Sound
    Daemon) support. You must have EsounD already installed before running
    `configure'. Use -o esd:[HOSTNAME] as args to `madplay'. If --with-esd
    is given to `configure', EsounD will be used for native audio output.

  * Added a new output module, audio_cdda, for creating CD audio images.
    Output is forced to 16-bit 44100 Hz stereo.

  * Added a new output module, audio_aiff, for Audio IFF (AIFF) format
    files.

  * Changed the audio_wave module to initially write ~0 length rather than
    0, for better compatibility when output is piped to another program.

  * Changed audio_oss module to try /dev/sound/dsp before /dev/dsp.

  * Added new -b (--bit-depth) option to `madplay'. Most output modules now
    support configurable bit depths.

  * Added new -i (--ignore-crc) option to `madplay'.

  * Changed Cygwin builds to use MinGW; resulting Win32 executables no
    longer have a dependency on Cygwin DLLs.

  * `madplay' now supports keyboard controls under Win32.

  * Made use of localeconv() conditional based on results from `configure'.

  * Made use of assert() portable to systems without <assert.h>.

  * Fixed my bad fix for avoiding log10(0).

Version 0.14.1 (beta)

  * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest upstream versions.

  * Fixed a NetBSD compatibility issue in audio_sun.

  * Fixed a FreeBSD compatibility issue in audio_oss.

  * Modified the audio_null output module to compute peak amplitude.

  * Changed the peak amplitude computation to avoid evaluating log10(0).

  * Several other small fixes.

Version 0.14.0 (beta)

  * Fixed a possible segmentation fault due to mmap() abuse.

  * Improved MSVC++ portability and added MSVC++ project files.

  * Modified the PCM dithering routine for better dithered output.

  * Added TTY controls and new --tty-control and --no-tty-control options to
    `madplay'. TTY control keys: `P' pause, `S' stop, `Q' quit, `F' forward,
    `B' backward.

  * New time/time-remaining modes with --verbose --tty-control (select by
    pressing `T'.)

Version 0.13.0 (beta)

  * The last complete audio frame should now be properly decoded even when
    it is not followed by other data.

  * Added new --downsample option to `madplay'.

Version 0.12.3 (beta)

  * Added calls to madvise() on supported systems to reduce memory overhead
    when using mmap().

  * Added support for automatic mono/stereo channel selection based on
    output capability.

  * Added a new option to force stereo output of single or dual channel
    streams.

  * Added a new option to amplify/attenuate the output signal by an amount
    expressed in decibels.

  * Output statistics (peak amplitude, clipped samples) are now gathered and
    displayed after decoding.

  * Fixed a problem calling setlocale() when NLS is disabled.

  * Fixed a configure problem when multiple -O CFLAGS are present.

Version 0.12.2 (beta)

  * Fixed another FreeBSD sound compatibility problem in audio_oss.c.

Version 0.12.1 (beta)

  * Rewrote the audio PCM packing routines for (hopefully) somewhat better
    performance.

  * Fixed a FreeBSD sound compatibility problem in audio_oss.c with help
    from Graham Guttocks.

  * Moved ID3 genre table into a separate file and updated extensions with
    current list from Winamp.

  * New Croatian, Norwegian, and Spanish translations courtesy of Mario
    Horvat, Christoffer Nicolaisen, and Damian Brizuela, respectively.

  * Added a simple ABX testing script.

Version 0.12.0 (alpha)

  * Changed the build environment to use automake and libtool. A libmad
    shared library can now be built using the --enable-shared option to
    `configure'.

  * Added internationalization support via GNU gettext. New French
    translation added courtesy of Gabriel Bouvigne.

  * Changed raw output module to use host-endian byte order.

  * Added --disable-mmap option to `configure' per suggestion of Erik
    Andersen.

  * Debug builds now link with -lefence, if available.

  * Added `madplay' support for filter chains. This could eventually be
    extended to support dynamically loaded filters.

  * Added a new optional fade-in filter.

  * Rewrote madplay.c to use GNU getopt, and added many new options (use
    `madplay --help' to see them all.)

  * Updated the man page for `madplay'.

Version 0.11.4 (beta)

  * Added Sun/NeXT audio file output module (audio_au.c).

  * Added 32-bit (really 24-bit) output support to OSS module.

  * Relaxed output sample frequency match requirement.

  * Fixed endian assumption problem in audio_sun.c.

  * Added -mtune=strongarm for all ARM targets.

Version 0.11.3 (beta)

  * Joint stereo mode now shows LR indicator during playback.

Version 0.11.2 (beta)

  * Added a dual channel output selection option.

  * Improved the OSS output module by falling back on 8-bit format if 16-bit
    is not available, and by using native 16-bit endianness.

  * PCM output is now dithered for better audio quality. A new runtime
    option can disable this feature.

  * Added a resampling feature for unsupported output sampling frequencies.

  * Centralized sample scaling and formatting in audio.c for the output
    modules.

  * Moved the empeg-car audio output support into a separate module.

  * Added bad-CRC frame muting code to madplay.c.

  * Changed `madtime' to indicate average bitrates.

  * Reduced the ID3 genre table memory usage.

  * Minor code clean-up.

Version 0.11.1 (beta)

  * Improved the robustness of the Win32 audio output module.

  * Added a short man page for madplay.

  * Wrote most of the code for madtime.

  * Wrote code for an experimental multi-stream mixer `madmix'
    (--enable-experimental to add -x option support for this to madplay).
