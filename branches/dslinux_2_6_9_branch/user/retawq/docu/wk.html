<p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>retawq supports several different window kinds. Most of the time, you'll
probably use windows of the kind "browser window"; in fact, you can use the
program without ever using any other window kind.</p>

<p>The kind of a window is always indicated in the title line of the window, so
you can easily recognize where you are and which operations might be available;
the title line begins with a letter which has the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>B - browser window</li>
<li>I - information window</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="browser"></a><b>Browser Window</b></p>

<p>Each browser window can contain an arbitrarily long series of "views"; each
view shows one document, e.g. one web page. You can navigate through the series
of views with the <a href="key.html">keyboard commands</a> "Cursor-left" and
"Cursor-right"; this works like the "Back" and "Forward" buttons in graphical
web browsers.</p>

<p><a name="info"></a><b>Information Window</b></p>

<p>Each information window contains one single document which conveys some
information about another document, the result of an operation or the internal
state of the program. The most usual information window contains information
about a browser window view and is created with the <a href="key.html">keyboard
command</a> "I".</p>

<p>If you follow a link in an information window, the resulting document is
shown in a newly created browser window.</p>
