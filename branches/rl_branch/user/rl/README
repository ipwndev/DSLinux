rl - Randomize Lines

rl reads lines from a input file or stdin, randomizes the lines and outputs a
specified number of lines. It does this with only a single pass over the input
while trying to use as little memory as possible.

I wrote rl in my spare time mainly to be able to select a random audio file to
play when my toast is done (script in combination with find and sleep).
Another reason was to familiarize myself with autoconf and friends.

The most recent version of rl can be found at
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/rl/

Warning: The command line options and default behaviour may change between
releases until a 1.0 release is made.

Another Warning: I have mostly lost interest in this project and am not
planning on doing much development on it any more. I will however still accept
patches and fix important bugs (this more or less contradicts the previous
warning).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

rl should compile fine on most Unix-like operating systems. It is written to
be as portable as possible.

rl is developed on Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (sarge) and unstable (sid) and tested
on Solaris 8 (once in a while), OpenBSD 2.7 (hardly ever) and HP-UX 10 (a long
time ago).

rl uses a configure script to guess build parameters for your system.
Configuration, compilation and installation should be as simple as this:

  % ./configure   (use --help for options)
  % make          (compile)
  % make install  (install)

For more details read the INSTALL file.


PLANS / TODO
------------

rl is still in development and there are more features to implement. The
development is currently based on the "it works for me" principle. For a list
of items that should still be done see the TODO file.

If you want any features added to rl or you have comments or questions you can
email me at arthur@ch.tudelft.nl. Patches for bug fixes and feature extensions
are appreciated.
