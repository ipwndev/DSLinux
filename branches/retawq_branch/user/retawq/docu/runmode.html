<p>retawq can be run in any of the following modes. The desired runmode is
detected when the program is started, doesn't change afterwards as long as the
program runs and depends on <a href="arg.html">command-line options</a>. The
most usual mode is probably the "curses-like" mode.</p>

<ul>
<li>console: a "raw" text console which doesn't use any curses library support;
similar to those very old shell-like FTP clients, but more flexible; cf. <a
href="custom_conn.html">Custom Connections</a>; this runmode is activated with
the <a href="arg.html">command-line option</a> "--console"; interactive</li>
<li>curses-like: this is the default mode when none of the others is explicitly
activated; it provides a "usual" text-mode web browser: the functionality of a
curses/ncurses library or emulation is used (as specified with the <a
href="ctconfig.html">compile-time configuration option</a> OPTION_TG), and you
can work interactively</li>
<li>download: this runmode is activated with the <a
href="arg.html">command-line option</a> "--download"; automated,
non-interactive</li>
<li>dump: this runmode is activated with the <a href="arg.html">command-line
option</a> "--dump"; automated, non-interactive</li>
</ul>

<p>Planned, not yet there:</p>
<ul>
<li>GTK: using the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> library;
interactive</li>
<li>X: using pure <a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a>;
interactive</li>
</ul>
