<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What is it?</B><BR>
<BR>
The BAssPasC (<I>BAPC3</I>) programming <B><I>language</I></B>
has been made for those Assembly language programmers who want
to make fast and small program code, but are striving for faster
development, easier overview and less typing.<BR>
<BR>
In first approach, the BAPC is a expansion for the assembly language
in the form of a <B><I>macro-set</I>.</B> But then today it covers
the full assembly, nearly everything can be written using just
the BAPC instructions. With the LIBs the BAPC can be ranked among
the high level computer languages, it steps much over the level
being just a macro-set.<BR>
<BR>
The philosophy of BAPC programming doesn't differ much 
from <B><I>assembly</I></B>, but it results in a smaller,
tenser and more perspicuous source. This way bigger, more complicated
programs can be written, whose handling was more labored in asm.
For this BAPC gives lots of possibilities: for example the fast
compiling of BPO, easier handling of binary files or the possibility
of defining the visibility of the labels.<BR>
<BR>
<B>For the acquisition of the BAPC the Assembly knowledge is required!</B><BR>
<BR>
BAPC is a <B><I>mix of languages</I></B>, because it mainly includes
Pascal, C, Basic and Perl instructions (with more or less modifications).
You may program much easier and faster under BAPC than in assembly,
but contrast to the high level languages the program would be
so fast and short as it would be written in pure assembly. The
compiler generates Assembly (.ASM) language files directly, which can
be used in many ways: i.e.: can be compiled to .COM or .EXE file
without any changes in the program sources, or can be built into
another language (i.e.: WATCOM C). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Platforms:</B><BR>
<I>host:</I> DOS-16bit and LINUX+DosRunner<BR>
<I>target:</I> the BAPC language is OS-independent, but current
LIBs are for DOS-16bit and some for DOS-DPMI<BR>
<BR>
<B>Supported assemblers:</B><BR>
BAPC was designed for TASM 3.0, but other versions of TASM,
MASM and NASM are supported now.<BR>
