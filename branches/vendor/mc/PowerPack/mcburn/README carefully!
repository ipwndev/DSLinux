MC Burn v0.1-beta by Bart Friederichs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!!! See original mcburn.txt AFTER you read THIS README file !!!


NOTE from Olegarch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Someone send me these source files, and I adopt it for my branch of MC.
It's too wet to include it into distro, but, if someone needs this, take 
it, integrate and use. :)

HOWTO integrate MC-Burn with mc-MP:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As wrote author of this patch/plugin/update, we need to copy "Makefile.in" into 
"src" dir, go to upper level, rm configure.cache and start "mc.configure".

It's no enough.

Need to make some additins into mc body to see mcburn "in work".


First of all - add this string after all of includes in main.c:

#include "mcburn.h"

Later add in menu "command" in main.c:

    { ' ', N_("Write CD"),                      'R', burn_cmd },
    { ' ', "", ' ', 0 },

Add in menu "options" in main.c:

    { ' ', "", ' ', 0 },
    { ' ', N_("CD bu&Rning..."),       'R', burn_config },
    { ' ', "", ' ', 0 },

Add this function for working process:

int burn_cmd (void)
{
    do_burn (cpanel);
}

now compile it ind celebrate.
