 This is the port of Midnight Commander for OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows NT.

 This port is based on the port for Windows NT by
    Juan Grigera <grigera@isis.unlp.edu.ar>
and the port for OS/2 by
    Alexander Dong <ado@software-ag.de>
and is currently maintained by
    Pavel Roskin <pavel.roskin@ecsoft.co.uk>

 This port of the Midnight Commander is released under the GNU General
Public License version 2.0 or any later version. See file COPYING for
details.

 Following compilers are supported:
    For Windows NT:
	Makefile.VC4:	Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and above
	Makefile.BC5:	Borland C++ 5.x
    For OS/2:
	Makefile.EMX:	EMX/GCC
	Makefile.BC2:	Borland C++ 2.x
	Makefile.IBM:	IBM CSet or Visual Age C++

 You need GNU make in order to compile mc. Other implementation of
make will not work! Run

gmake -f Makefile.xxx [RELEASE=1]

where gmake is name of GNU make and Makefile.xxx is the makefile for
your compiler. You may want to add RELEASE=1 if you want to compile an
optimized version without debug information.
 Please note, that not all compilers are equal. You may need to create
dummy include files or change something in order to be able to compile
mc. BUT PLEASE DON'T TRY TO INCORPORATE SUCH QUICK HACKS INTO THE
MC DISTRIBUTION! Try to make your changes work with all other compilers.
 If you add a file, don't forget to add it into FILES statement of
Makefile in this directory. Otherwise this file will not be copied to
the distribution.
 This port is not very stable now. See files BUGS and TODO in this
directory.
