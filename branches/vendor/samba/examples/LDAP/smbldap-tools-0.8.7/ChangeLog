## ChangeLog for SMBLDAP-TOOLS


3005-02-13: new tag (v0-8-7 for rpm version 0.8.7)
	. update smbldap-populate: check previously if entries exist. If the sambaDomain entry
	  already exist when using smbldap-populate, we just modify it to add the sambaUnixIdPool
	  objectclass which store the first uidNumber and gidNumber available.
	. update connection procedure to the directory in smbldap-passwd
	. new script smbldap-userinfo from Pawel Wieleba to allow people update their own
	  informations like telephoneNumber, name and some others (need proper ACL in ldap
	  configuration)
	. new migration scripts from Pawel Wieleba smbldap-migrate-unix-accounts and
	  smbldap-migrate-unix-groups to help migrating users and groups defined in /etc/passwd (and/or
	  /etc/shadow) and /etc/group.
2005-01-29
	. bug in smbldap-populate: the -b option (guest login name) was broken
	. new option '-k' and '-l' to smbldap-populate to defined the uidNumber of administrator and
	  guest accounts
	. group "Account Operators" is now created with smbldap-populate
	. Administrator account does not need anymore uidNumber=0 (using 998)
	. update in smbldap-populate and smbldap.conf:
	  . next uidNumber and gidNumber available for new users and new groups are now
	    stored in the sambaDomainName object. This allow the sambaUnixIdPooldn to not
	    been viewed as a real user under IMC (http://www.idealx.org/prj/imc/)
	    sambaUnixIdPooldn in configuration file smbldap.conf must look like
	    > sambaUnixIdPooldn="sambaDomainName=MYDOMAIN,${suffix}"
	  . the sambaDomainName is determine by 
	    - the sambaUnixIdPooldn parameter of smbldap.conf, or
	    - the workgroup parameter of smb.conf if sambaUnixIdPooldn is not a sambaDomainName
	      object
	. patch to smbldap-useradd: $modify->code was executed even if no modification was required,
	  this can cause error mesage with some ldap directory.
	. small typo corrections
2005-16-01: new tag (v0-8-6 for rpm version 0.8.6)
2005-06-01:
	. new location /opt/IDEALX and /etc/opt/IDEALX/ (instead of /usr/local and /etc)
	  to conform to FHS/LSB
	. update typo correction in documentation
	. patch to smbldap-passwd from Pawel Wieleba <wielebap@volt.iem.pw.edu.pl>:
	   see www.iem.pw.edu.pl/~wielebap/ldap/smbldap-tools/smbldap-tools_doc.pdf
	  . use of slappasswd was insecure as external program. Now slappasswd is run in
	    a child process and shell is not used
	  . it is now possible to not use slappasswd but perl module only
	  . new parameter 'with_slappasswd' in smbldap.conf to allow not use 'slappasswd'
	    but perl module only
	. new option '-r' to smbldap-usermod for renaming a user. Exemple:
	  $ smbldap-usermod -d /home/new_user -r new_user old_user
2004-10-28: new tag (v0-8-5-3 for rpm version 0.8.5-3)
2004-10-07:
	. smbldap-useradd: set sambaPwdLastSet to the current date, and sambaPwdMustChange
	  to 2147483647 for trust account to work
	. patch from Quentin Delance <quentin.delance@insalien.org>:
	  added test to not being able to remove primary group of a user
2004-08-29: new tag (v0-8-5-2 for rpm version 0.8.5-2)
	. small corrections
	. computer's account have the 'gecos' attribute set to 'computer': computers may not
	  join the domain if this attribute is not defined (thanks to "Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski")
2004-06-25:
	. patch to smbldap_tools.pm: the 'search' to sambaUnixIdPool objectclass is done
	  directly to the object defined in the configuration file (sambaUnixIdPooldn="...").
	  This allow to have more then one object having the sambaUnixIdPool objectclass.
	. patch smbldap-useradd. The -P and -T options had no effect if the -a was not used.
	. update configure.pl
2004-06-21:
	. new '-o' option in smbldap-useradd to set the organizatinal unit where the account
	  will be created. It is relative of the user suffix dn ($usersdn) defined in the
	  configuration file
2004-06-17: new tag (v0-8-5-1 for rpm version 0.8.5-1)
	. update documentation
2004-05-25:
	. patch to smbldap-populate:
	  fix sambaSID and sambaGroupType error for builtin groups
	. new entry in /etc/smbldap-tools/smbldap.conf for idmap ou:
	  > idmapdn="ou=Idmap,${suffix}"
2004-05-10:
	. patch from Ross Becker <ross@rbecker.org> :
	  new option in smbldap.conf to set the salt format if CRYPT hash is used.
	. add a check to see if STDIN is connected to tty by using if (-t STDIN) ...
	  This allow the unsecure use of "echo -e 'password\npassword' | smbldap-passwd jto"
2004-04-30:
	. patch for smbldap-useradd and smbldap-groupadd: next uidNumber and gidNumber available
	  are now stored in cn=NextFreeUnixId
	  WARNING:
	  . when upgrading, you need to create the new object manually (see INSTALL file)
	  . this object's name is defined in /etc/smbldap-tools/smbldap.conf
	    you can defined another name as desired, for example:
	    > sambaUnixIdPooldn="cn=NextFreeUnixId,${suffix}"
2004-04-07:
	. patch from Emmanuel Lacour <elacour@home-dn.net> :
	  no more use of mkntpwd, use of Crypt::SmbHash perl module instead
2004-04-04:
	. patchs from Alexander Bergolth <leo@strike.wu-wien.ac.at> :
	  . variable substitution to the config-file parser.
	    This new feature allows configurations like that
	      > suffix="dc=idealx,dc=com"
	      > usersdn="ou=Users,${suffix}"
	    Username substitution is done via %U:
	      > userHome="/home/%U"
            ==> smbldap.conf file can now use the samba %U definition
	  . change in smbldap-userdel refuses deleting a home directory that doesn't contain
	    the username, more precisely that doesn't look like /^\/.+\/(.*)$user/
	    This avoids deleting-disasters when the homeDirectory attribute is
	    erroneous set to a wrong value like "/" or "/home".
	  . adds mail-forwarding and mail-alias capabilities (for use by MTAs like sendmail or
            postfix). Two new options "-M" and "-T" allow specifying mail-aliases and mail-forward
	    addresses in smbldap-useradd and smbldap-usermod. If those options are used, the
	    objectclass "inetLocalMailRecipient" is used
	  . patch to allows adding new mail-aliases (-M), mail-forward addresses (-T) or
	    supplementary groups (-G) without overwriting the existing ones using a syntax like
		smbldap-usermod -G +wheel testuser
	    Removing only the specified attributes without deleting all of them works the same way
	    using a syntax like
		smbldap-usermod -G -wheel testuser
	  . patch that fixes a small problem when using userHomeDrive without the ":" symbol
	. test if a user is unique in get_homedir function. Replace the regular expression that check
          the homeDirectory attribute's value with the exact query response.
2004-03-05:
	. add the displayName attribut when using 'smbldap-groupadd -a'
	. update smbldap-populate (set the username for the guest account and the
	  administrative account in sambaProfilePath instead of $adminName and $guestName)
2004-03-01:
	. update smbldap-populate to allow setting userHomeDrive="" in configuration file
2004-02-22:
	. it is now possible to delete the following entries with smbldap-usermod :
	  sambaHomePath (option -C), sambaHomeDrive (option -D)
	  sambaLogonScript (option -E) and sambaProfilePath (option -F)
	  ex: smbldap-usermod -C "" user
