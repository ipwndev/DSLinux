XBill history:

0.01 (7/21/94):  
	- Bill moves, and he's in color too.  You can even click on
		him and he excaims "OUCH!" or "SPLAT!"
	- window resizing is very wrong
	
0.02 (7/22/94):	
	- program no longer guaranteed to run predictably for 
		longer than nine years (sorry)
	- ridiculously improved code style (no really a lot!)
	- added linked list unit and support for multiple monsters
	- added support for computers
	- bill says "POW!!!!!!" on button 2
	- improved Makefile
	- remembered to include app-defaults file in tar

0.03 (7/24/94):
	- forgot to initialize a variable.  either the stupid aix compiler 
		initialized it anyway or we were really lucky testing it.
	- removed annoying flicker
	- has multiple computers on the screen with random OSes
	- has multiple bills moving on the screen in random directions
	- used sxpm to create smaller .xpm files, minor savings in memoy
		and executable size, easier to edit pixmaps
	- left button (button 1) removes bills from screen
	- right button (button 3) now resets computers to wingdows.

0.04 (7/25/94):
	- got masking to work (well, maybe not...)
	- bill now carries the wingdows box around
	- event handling/speed improved

0.1 (7/26/94):
	- masking really works now
	- fixed computer pixmap so it looks nice(r)
	- randomized computer layout now leaves room for bill to stand on right
	- support for bills walking in, standing at computers and walking out
	- bills walk towards a specific computer to plunder (primitive ai)
	- bill turns off computer, 'steals' native os and installs wingdows
	- count of bills remaining is kept: decreased when bill enters screen
					  - increased if bill leaves
	- bill is killable in all states
	- computer reset to native os on right button
	- cleaned up code and internal structures
	- event handling/speed really improved (optimized for the new code)
	- server lag problems identified
	- linked list unit fixed so that function to move between lists works
	- window resizing is still very wrong
	
0.2 (8/14/94)
	- programmers woke up after being asleep since 7/26.	
	- code structures were fixed very much (again)
	- bill faces in the direction he's walking
	- bill explodes in a gory shower of blood when clicked on (yeah!)
	- bill drops os when killed
	- the os stays on the ground when bill is killed if it had been stolen
	- the os bounces up and down while bill carries it
	- changed default cursor (matias will have to draw a better one later)
	- cursor changes during drag and drop operation
	- drag and drop works!  there's a little hack involved, but not 
		too bad...
	- bill now smart enough to notice that a computer is already
		corrupted and find a new one
	- game ends if all computers are lost

0.21 (8/15/94)
	- attempt to port code to athena widgets.  it compiles and
		runs w/o motif now (i hate C macros) a bit
	- improved the makefile.  an imakefile one day maybe...

0.22 (8/16/94)
	- when bill leaves the field, he drops the os he's carrying
	- status bar widget now does something

0.3 (8/23/94)
	- improved responsiveness a lot :)
	- menubar does something (new game, pause and quit buttons) if 
		motif is used.
	- levels now exist (barely)
	- yet more code cleanup

0.31 (8/24/94)
	- a few things depend on the level (freq. and number of appearing
		bills, number of computers, step size)
	- bug where a computer is ignored if off is removed
	- menu code written.
	- athena code started.  this works more or less, but not too well.
		i'd recommend using motif and/or a statically linked binary.

0.32 (9/18/94)
	- about box works.  help almost works also.
	- a bunch of bugs fixed
	- have an Imakefile now (thanks to Greg Seidman - anthro@cs.umd.edu)

0.9 (11/28/94 - a bit busier during school)
	- warp to arbitrary level works
	- game pauses when cursor leaves window
	- cursor warps to near upper left corner of opened dialog boxes
	- redefined both reset and drag to right button (button 3),
		added -1 option for people with a one button mouse.
		-1 may slow the game down a bit. 
	- added -l, -L to specify starting level
	- added -v for version info
	- improved pictures a lot
	- added confirmations for actions
	- game now pauses well
	- fixed level difficulty stuff
	- bill walks at two speeds
	- minimizes to an icon (a cool one too...)
	- scoring improved
	- window cannot be resized now, no matter how hard you try :)
	- much cooler animations for bill replacing os
	- added high score list
	- fixed lots of silly bugs
	- made program not die from colormap error (i hope)

1.0 (4/5/95-4/9/95)
	- remembered that the game's not done yet :)
	- replaced usleep() calls with XtAppAddTimeout().  should make
		the game more responsive
	- changed all popup windows to modal dialogs.  cleans up code
		a lot
	- removed Athena support, since it would take too long to finish.
	- made a couple pixmaps a bit smaller
	- changed colors to gray.  why not?
	- finally got everything to work with full colormaps
	- got rid of app-defaults file.  Not really used anyway
	- Only uses one button now (any button).  Easier to play.
	- Some Imakefile fixes

1.1 (4/16/95)
	- modularized widget code, and added Athena widget support (rewritten
		from scratch).  The game looks better with Motif, but that's
		not too important.
	- made pause button only active during game play
	- warping to a level starts a game if one isn't being played
	- fixed a potentially nasty bug that could cause bills to get lost
	- works in TrueColor now (I think - it works in 16 bit mode at least)

1.1a (9/22/95)
	- fixed bug where getopt() returned a char instead of an int.
	- fixed bug where hitting Enter when entering a high score
		corrupted the high score file.
	- don't fclose() nonexistant files any more.
	- added BSD as another operating system (patches by Joerg Wunsch,
		joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de)
	- it was really easy to play forever by guarding one computer.  Now
		you lose when there's only one computer left running its
		normal OS.
	- added man page, written by Pekka Marjola (marjola@trshp.ntc.nokia.com)

2.0 ()
	- changed around some timer code.
	- removed Athena DrawingArea widget since CoreWidget works too.
	- massive code reorganization to improve portability to other
		GUIs, languages, etc.
	- Some computers are connected by network cables
	- When a computer with a network cable becomes infected, it will
		release a spark down the cable which will infect the
		computer on the other end.  Pouring the bucket of water
		on the spark will extinguish it.
	- Made cursors and various other images look better.
	- Removed references to defenestration.dorm.umd.edu, which no
		longer exists.
	- Added Red Hat logo (fixed broken Red Hat patch).
	- Added GNU Hurd logo
	- Added Linux penguin logo
	- The BSD, Red Hat, Linux, OS/2, and Hurd operating systems are
		interchangable on the 2 PC computers.
	- The score is now displayed in the playing field.
	- Made Athena version far better looking.
	- Motif version almost completely works with Lesstif.
