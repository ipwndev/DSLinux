README - Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) Version 1.0.7
-------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS FLTK?

    The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a LGPL'd
    C++ graphical user interface toolkit for X (UNIX(r)), OpenGL(r),
    and Microsoft(r) Windows(r) NT 4.0, 95, or 98. It was originally
    developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a
    small group of developers across the world with a central
    repository in the US.


LICENSING

    FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available under
    the terms of the GNU Library General Public License. Contrary to
    popular belief, it can be used in commercial software! (Even Bill
    Gates could use it.) 


ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION

    All of the documentation is in HTML in the subdirectory
    "documentation". The "index.html" file should be your starting
    point.  PostScript(tm) and PDF versions of this documentation is
    also available from the FLTK web site at:

        http://fltk.easysw.com/documentation.html


BUILDING AND INSTALLING FLTK UNDER UNIX

    In most cases you can just type "make".  This will run configure
    with the default (no) options and then compile everything.

    FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX platform.
    The main things that the configure script will look for are the
    X11, OpenGL (or Mesa), and JPEG header and library files.  Make
    sure that they are in the standard include/library locations.  If
    they aren't you need to define the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
    environment variables.

    If you aren't using "gcc", "g++", "c++", or "CC" for your C++
    compiler, you'll also need to set the CXX environment variable.
    Similarly, if you aren't using "gcc" or "cc" for your C compiler
    you'll need to set the CC environment variable.

    You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you need.
    Type "./configure <options>".  Options include:

	--enable-debug          - Enable debugging code & symbols
	--enable-shared         - Enable generation of shared libraries

	--bindir=/path          - Set the location for executables
                        	  [default = /usr/local/bin]
	--libdir=/path          - Set the location for libraries
                        	  [default = /usr/local/lib]
	--includedir=/path      - Set the location for include files.
                        	  [default = /usr/local/include]
	--prefix=/dir           - Set the directory prefix for files
                        	  [default = /usr/local]

    When the configure script is done you can just run the "make"
    command. This will build the library, FLUID tool, and all of the
    test programs.

    To install the library, become root and type "make install".  This
    will copy the "fluid" executable to "bindir", the header files to
    "includedir", and the library files to "libdir".


BUILDING FLTK UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS

    There are two ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows.  The
    first is to use the 5.0 project files under the "visualc"
    directory.  Just open (or double-click on) the "fltk.dsw" file to
    get the whole shebang.

    The second method is to use a GNU-based development tool with the
    files in the "makefiles" directory.  To build using one of these
    tools simply copy the appropriate makeinclude and config files to
    the main directory and do a make:

	copy makefiles\Makefile.<env> Makefile
	make


BUILDING FLTK UNDER OS/2

    The current OS/2 build requires XFree86 for OS/2 to work.  A native
    Presentation Manager version has not been implemented yet
    (volunteers are welcome!).

    To build the XFree86 version of FLTK for OS/2, copy the appropriate
    makeinclude and config files to the main directory and do a make:

        copy makefiles\Makefile.os2x Makefile
	make


INTERNET RESOURCES

    FLTK is available on the 'net in a bunch of locations:

	- WWW:   http://www.fltk.org

	- EMail: fltk@fltk.org [see instructions below]
        	 fltk-bugs@fltk.org [for reporting bugs]

    To send a message to the FLTK mailing list ("fltk@fltk.org") you

REPORTING BUGS

    To report a bug in FLTK, send an email to "fltk-bugs@fltk.org".
    Please include the FLTK version, operating system & version, and
    compiler that you are using when describing the bug or problem.

    For general support and questions, please use the FLTK mailing
    list at "fltk@fltk.org".


MESA

    Currently the best way to get OpenGL on your Linux system is to use
    Mesa.  FLTK has been tested with Mesa on several machines (and also
    with "real" OpenGL on SGI machines).

    Mesa is available at "http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html".

    The configure script will not see Mesa unless it is installed as
    either libGL or libMesaGL.  If you don't want to do this you will
    have to edit config.h (set HAVE_GL to 1) and makeinclude (add the
    libraries).
