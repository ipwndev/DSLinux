flnx 0.15 (Microwindows Version 0.89pre6) - 16th Nov 2000 - jeffm@censoft.com
	- Resloved Microwindows issue for not redrawing bitmaps on buttons.
	  Submitted patch to Microwindows project.
	- Revamped X,Y coordinate system to be more like FLTK 1.0.7. Now,
	  widgets in many nested windows work correctly.
	- Catching Microwindows update resize and move events.
	- Added Fl_Window_Resize class for to catch Microwindows window 
	  managers resize events.
	- Implemented virtual resize_notify method so you can give application
	  specific instructions for resizing (or you could just call the 
	  default resize).
	- Fluid now works under Microwindows (Now you can design apps on your
	  PDA!)
flnx 0.14 (Microwindows Version 0.89pre5) - 2nd Nov 2000 - jeffm@censoft.com
	- Dialog boxes ( and other child windows ) are now correctly destroyed by nanox window managers.
	- Fixed checkers demo ( see flnx/test/checkers.cxx)
	- Fixed cursors to change at correct hotspots ( see flnx/test/tile.cxx )
	- Fixed cursors to change to correct foreground and background colors ( see flnx/test/cursor.cxx ).
	  Note: we are still working on getting all the cursor bitmaps to include. Currently we only have some
	  default cursors.
	- Now requests fonts by name as if they were TrueType.
	- Now responds with font that matches most closely  
	  the size you request in lieu of the actual TrueType font.
	- Added TODO list concerning defects and unfinished tasks.
	- Added INSTALL documentation. 
flnx 0.13 (Microwindows Version 0.89pre3) - 25th Oct 2000 - jeffm@censoft.com
	- Fixed first and third mouse button reversal problem between flnx and microwindows.
	- Fixed Fl_Overlay.
	- Fixed many window decorating and parenting problems inside of nanowm.
	- Menus are no longer clipped by parent windows.
	- Fixed file selection box.
	- FL_ROUND_UP_BOX and FL_ROUND_DOWN_BOX look even better.
	- Increased speed of True Type Fonts (much better!).
	- Fixed Fl_vertex.cxx's fl_circle() ... it is now "polygon aware" (i.e. see clock demo).
	- Fixed pop-up menu on right click.
	
flnx 0.12 (Microwindows Version 0.89pre3) - 18th Oct 2000 - jeffm@censoft.com 
	- The event loop completely redone (FLNX under nanox is much faster).
	- The event loop can now handle FL_TIMEOUT events properly (i.e. see
  	  flnx/test/tabs)
	- Menu Bars and Menu Buttons do not decorate inside of nanowm.
	- Menu Bars and Menu Buttons events work correctly (i.e. draw in the
  	  correct position).
  	- Parts of Fl_Dial do not disappear after use.
  	- Fl_Windows have FL_BLACK borders instead of FL_RED borders.
  	- Window Parenting works better (i.e. see flnx/tests/tile demo).
  	- Fl_Scroll now scrolls when other widgets are placed inside.
  	- Double buffering works.
  	- Fl_Box types FL_ROUND_BOX and FL_ROUND_DOWN_BOX draw correctly.
  	- Fl_Bitmap works correctly.
  	- Fl_Pixmap works correctly.
  	- Fl_Image works (nanox server side draws images REALLY slow on X, it is
  	  faster with framebuffer).
