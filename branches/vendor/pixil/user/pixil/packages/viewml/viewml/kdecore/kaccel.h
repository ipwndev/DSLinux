/**
 * The KAccel class handles keyboard accelerators, allowing a user to configure
 * key bindings through application configuration files or through the
 * KKeyChooser GUI.
 *
 * A KAccel contains a list of accelerator items. Each accelerator item
 * consists of an action name and a keyboard code combined with modifiers
 * (SHIFT, CTRL and ALT.)
 *
 * For example, "CTRL+P" could be a shortcut for printing a document. The key
 * codes are listed in ckey.h. "Print" could be the action name for printing.
 * The action name indentifies the key binding in configuration files and the
 * KKeyChooser GUI.
 *
 * When pressed, an accelerator key calls the slot to which it has been
 * connected. Accelerator items can be connected so that a key will activate
 * two different slots.
 *
 * A KAccel object handles key events to its parent widget and all children
 * of this parent widget.
 *
 * Key binding configuration during run time can be prevented by specifying
 * that an accelerator item is not configurable when it is inserted. A special
 * group of non-configurable key bindings are known as the standard accelerators.
 *
 * The standard accelerators appear repeatedly in applications for
 * standard document actions like printing and saving. Convenience methods are
 * available to insert and connect these accelerators which are configurable on
 * a desktop-wide basis.
 *
 * It is possible for a user to choose to have no key associated with an action.
 *
 * The translated first argument for insertItem is only used in the
 * configuration dialog.
 *<pre>
 * KAccel *a = new KAccel( myWindow );
 * a->insertItem( i18n("Scroll up"), "Scroll Up", "Up" );
 * a->connectItem( "Scroll up", myWindow, SLOT( scrollUp() ) );
 * // a->insertStdItem( KAccel::Print ); //not necessary, since it
 	// is done automatially with the
 	// connect below!
 * a->connectItem(KAccel::Print, myWindow, SLOT( printDoc() ) );
 *
 * a->readSettings();
 *</pre>
 *
 * If a shortcut has a menu entry as well, you could insert them like
 * this. The example is again the KAccel::Print from above.

 <pre>
 * int id;
 * id = popup->insertItem("&Print",this, SLOT(printDoc()));
 * a->changeMenuAccel(popup, id, KAccel::Print );
 </pre>
 *
 * If you want a somewhat "exotic" name for your standard print action, like
 *   id = popup->insertItem(i18n("Print &Document"),this, SLOT(printDoc()));
 * it might be a good idea to insert the standard action before as
 *          a->insertStdItem( KAccel::Print, i18n("Print Document") )
 * as well, so that the user can easily find the corresponding function.
 *
 * This technique works for other actions as well, your scroll up function
 * in a menu could be done with
 *
 <pre>
 *    id = popup->insertItem(i18n"Scroll &up",this, SLOT(scrollUp()));
 *    a->changeMenuAccel(popup, id, "Scroll Up" );
 </pre>
 *
 * Please keep the order right: first insert all functions in the
 * acceleratior, then call a->readSettings() and _then_ build your
 * menu structure.

 * @short Configurable key binding support.
 * @version $Id$
