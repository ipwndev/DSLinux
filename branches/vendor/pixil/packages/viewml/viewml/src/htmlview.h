 * @short Widget for displaying HTML.  Manages srcollbars and frames.
 *
 * This widget makes displaying HTML text very easy. It handles scrollbars
 * and stuff. It is able to handle most HTML 3.x including tables and frames.
 * To fill the widget with content you should do the follwing:
 * <PRE>
 * view->begin( "file:/tmp/test.html" );
 * view->parse();
 * view->write( "&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;...." );
 * .....
 * view->end();
 * view->show();
 * </PRE>
 * The widget will care for resize events and paint events and for scrolling.
 * Have a look at the set of signals emitted by this widget. You should connect
 * to most of them.
