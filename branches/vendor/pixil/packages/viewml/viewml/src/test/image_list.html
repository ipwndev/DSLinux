This is a short html-page to show you one layout problem remaining in
the khtmlw widget. I tried to fix it last night, but didn't get to
solve the problem. Perhaps you have any idea. Just remove the
align=left token from the img tag, or change it to align-right, and
the whole list below will get layoutet correctly.
<br>
<ul>
<li> an item
<li> This is a long list item to show you the problem... It will reach
out of the right side of the html widget.
<li> another item. 
</ul>
Resizing sometimes (but only sometimes) seems to correct the placement
of _some_ icons...
