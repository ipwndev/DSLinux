FEATURES
--------

Limitations :
  - The plugin and the player use XShm extensions, so remote display is not possible.
  - No Flash 4 features (but no crash on Flash 4 files).

Not functional :
  - No Morphing.
  - No vertical anti-aliasing.

SOUND SUPPORT
-------------

Limitations :
  - No streamed sound supported (interleaved data).
  - No sound envelop. So no fading or balancing effect.

But the main feature is here and sound can be enjoyed.

I recommend OSS drivers, but it is not required at all
(http://www.opensound.com)

If you have troubles with sound put the -DNOSOUND option
for compilation. Also do this for non-Linux Unix.

THE PLAYER
----------

The standalone player can simply control movie by
pressing Q to quit, P to pause, C to continue and
R to replay.
There is also the possibility to zoom in or out
and scroll using Keypad +/- and cursor keys, but
it is buggy on frozen images.

THE SCREEN SAVERS
-----------------

The standalone player can be run though xscreensaver. Modify
your .xscreensaver file to add swfplayer:
programs: swfplayer -root /home/olivier/Flash/Test/test.swf
(See xscreensaver doc for more details on Xscreensaver).

For KDE, just install the kflash.kss file from the Kflash
directory in /usr/bin (or where your KDE installation expects
kss file to be).
In your KDE start menu, select Settings->Desktop->Screensaver
Choose 'Flash Movies' and click on SetUp button. You'll have
to select a Flash file (take the test.swf file provided with
this distribution). The fullscreen option will scale the movie
to the entire screen (it can be very CPU intensive). The
enable sound option will allow to play sounds, but as a screen
saver mode this is not a good idea :)

BUG REPORT
----------

If Netscape crashes when it started to play a Flash file, please
report the complete url where you have found the file.
Do not send the actual file !

If you have rendering problem also report the url.

If the plugin does not seem to show anything or does not do what it
is supposed to do, please consider that the plugin does not support
all Flash 2/4 features. Anyway it tries to play it but may fail then.

COMPILATION
-----------

If you use Linux just type 'make'.

Warning : the plugin compilation should not fail, but you may
have problem with Netscape at startup. See INSTALLATION section
for workarounds.

For other Unices like FreeBSD or Solaris you may have to change
some flags. See Plugin/Makefile for hints.

INSTALLATION
------------

Once you have successfully compiled the plugin, put the file
npflash.so (located in the Plugin directory) into your
~/.netscape/plugins directory or into the system-wide
/opt/netscape/plugins directory (depends on where you have installed
Netscape).

If Netscape already runs type 'javascript:navigator.plugins.refresh'
in the Location field.

	PROBLEMS
	--------

If you have problem to successfully install the plugin, please
read the following hints. Otherwise, report the problem with full
description of your configuration :
- Distribution.
- Compiler.
- Libs (the output of ldconfig -p is useful).
- The netscape version and the output of 'ldd netscape'.

If some symbols like _rtti or _throw are unresolved, it seems
that you have egcs. Just uncomment the proper line in the main
Makefile.
You may then still have some unresolved symbols like __sigsetjmp.
This time, add -DC6R5 in the Plugin/Makefile at the PLUGIN_DEFINES
line.

	CHECKING
	--------

To verify that the plugin is installed properly, type "about:plugins"
in Netscape's "Location:" or "Netsite:" field.  The plugin should show
up there, something like

If it shows up, but the "Enabled" column says "No", you need to
configure the Flash plugin as a helper application.  Go to
Edit/Preferences/Navigator/Applications, and add it as follows:

Description: Flash Plugin
MIME Type: application/x-shockwave-flash
Suffixes: swf
Handled By: Plug In (select "Shockwave Flash")
