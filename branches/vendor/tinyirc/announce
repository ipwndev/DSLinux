FOR RELEASE NOVEMBER 11, 1994 --

TINYIRC VERSION 1.0 IS NOW AVAILABLE!

Tinyirc was developed on SunOS 4.1.3, and has been verified
compatable with hpux, linux 1.3.51, AIX, DYNIX, and will probably
run on many other platforms using one of the make options.

it is available via anonymous ftp to ftp.netcom.com
in /pub/Linux/tinyirc-1.0.tar.gz  this tar file is 13k
because it includes the GNU public licence.

PLEASE NOTE- The termcap-based version of tinyirc has fewer
features than the curses-based version, and development will
continue in this direction.   If you want to use the curses
version of tinyirc, I highly recommend installing ncurses
on your system and linking with it.   ncurses is available
on ftp.netcom.com /pub/zmbenhal/ncurses

ncurses routines may be integrated into tinyirc sometime
in the future and the termcap version dropped (next version?)
