For 1.06

1. export ECC functions globally [e.g. mulmod and the sets]
   - goal is tv_gen module and test vectors
2. ASN.1 SET and T61String
3. phase out DH code [RSA/ECC/DSA is enough]
4. Some ASN.1 demo programs [for now read the source code!]
5. Start working towards making the bignum code plugable
6. Look into other ECC point muls and consider a "precomp" interface 
7. Add OID for ciphers and PRNGs to their descriptors
