things for book in order of importance...

- Fix up pseudo-code [only] for combas that are not consistent with source
- Start in chapter 3 [basics] and work up...
   - re-write to prose [less abrupt]
   - clean up pseudo code [spacing]
   - more examples where appropriate and figures

Goal:
   - Get sync done by mid January [roughly 8-12 hours work]
   - Finish ch3-6 by end of January [roughly 12-16 hours of work]
   - Finish ch7-end by mid Feb [roughly 20-24 hours of work].

Goal isn't "first edition" but merely cleaner to read.
