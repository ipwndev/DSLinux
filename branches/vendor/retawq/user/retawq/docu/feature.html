<p><a name="ui"></a><b>User Interface Features</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>multi-window</b> - you can open as many "virtual windows" as you like
and work simultaneously in two of them in a split-screen mode</li>
<li><b>multi-view</b> - you can view a long series of documents within each
browser window and easily go back and forth</li>
<li><b>internationalization (i18n)</b> - optional support for several natural
languages (currently English, French, German, Spanish and Brazilian
Portuguese); cf. the <a href="ctconfig.html">compile-time configuration
option</a> OPTION_I18N</li>
<li><b>mouse</b> - optional mouse support for higher comfort; cf. the <a
href="ctconfig.html">compile-time configuration option</a>
OPTION_TEXTMODEMOUSE</li>
<li><b>contextual menus</b> - so you need not remember all those boring <a
href="key.html">keyboard commands</a> :-)</li>
<li><b>sessions</b> - you can save current <a href="session.html">sessions</a>
and resume them at any later time</li>
<li><b>keymaps</b> - for the flexible association of keys with program
actions</li>
<li><b>incremental display</b> - content is displayed as soon as it is received
from the server; you need not twiddle thumbs until the whole document (or a
large portion of it) has been received</li>
<li><b>resizable terminals</b> - retawq tries to utilize the extents of your
terminal optimally; and when you resize it, the visible documents are
immediately re-layouted within the new boundaries (if the libraries on your
computer support this); any terminal size from 30x10 to 250x250 characters
(width x height) is supported.</li>
<li><b>several interfaces</b> - there's more than just a web browser: you can
start the program in different <a href="runmode.html">runmodes</a>, e.g. to
download a file "in the background" or to get a shell-like FTP client</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="tech"></a><b>Technical Features</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>configurability</b> - many <a href="ctconfig.html">compile-time</a>, <a
href="arg.html">command-line</a> and <a href="rtconfig.html">run-time</a>
configuration options are provided; additionally, you can choose the
classical-style Makefile or the more modern/portable configure script</li>
<li><b>multi-threading</b> - retawq optionally uses (moderate) multi-threading
in order to make fast, responsive use possible</li>
<li><b>network protocols</b> - several access methods are supported: HTTP/1.1
and 1.0 (including proxies and cookies), https (ditto), FTP, ftps, news/NNTP,
finger, local files and directories, local CGI scripts; cf. <a
href="scheme.html">URL Schemes</a> for more information; other protocols will
follow</li>
<li><b>HTML renderer</b> - more than 60 tags are known; the form support is
quite complete (except file upload); more than 130 character entities are
known, many others can be guessed; preliminary (little) support for tables and
framesets exists</li>
<li><b>IPv6</b> - optional support for the "next generation" Internet Protocol
version; cf. the <a href="ctconfig.html">compile-time configuration option</a>
OPTION_IPV6</li>
<li><b>fast, small, portable and stable</b> - a special emphasis is put on
keeping the program very fast and small but making it comfortable, nicely
configurable and standards-compliant nevertheless</li>
<li><b>low requirements</b> - runs nicely even on slow computers with little
memory; also doesn't require much from its environment: only a standard C
library with rather little functionality is needed, anything else can be either
disabled or configured to use existing libraries or to fall back on built-in
replacements</li>
</ul>
