<ul>

<li><font color="red"><b>Q:</b></font> How do you pronounce "retawq"?
<br><font color="red"><b>A:</b></font> Roughly like "re-talk".</li>

<li><font color="red"><b>Q:</b></font> There are already <i>soo</i> many web
browsers out there - why did you create another one?
<br><font color="red"><b>A:</b></font> True, there are already many browsers.
But most of them are too big, too slow or too uncomfortable in my opinion, or
they just crash twice per hour or have bad privacy and security problems. I
wanted to find out whether it's possible to develop something better. :-)</li>

<li><font color="red"><b>Q:</b></font> What a strange name - "retawq"... What
does that mean?
<br><font color="red"><b>A:</b></font> Read it backwards, imagine that "q" is
an abbreviation for "quick" and consider that a web browser is as important for
netizens as water is for real human beings. :-) Or maybe the name is an anagram
of "raw teq", meaning "raw technology"?</li>
