retawq is an interactive, multi-threaded network client (web browser) for text
terminals on computers with Unix-like operating systems. It is written in C,
fast, small, nicely configurable, and comfortable; e.g. the low-level network
communications are performed in a non-blocking way, and you can keep open as
many "virtual windows" as you want and work simultaneously in two of them in a
split-screen mode.

Requirements: a Unix-like operating system, a C compiler; recommended: a curses
library for text terminal control, a pthreads (Posix threads) library

For installation instructions, read the file INSTALL.

For extensive documentation, open the file retawq/docu/index.html with a web
browser.

The project home page is <http://retawq.sourceforge.net/>. There you can find
more information about the project and the most recent version of the package.

Please note that this is an early release of retawq (technobabble: "alpha
development status"). Although it works for me, it might have severe bugs -
this project is still quite experimental...
