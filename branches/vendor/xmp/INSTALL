Requirements
------------

- This package needs the GNU make. In BSD or SysV you may need to use
  gmake instead of make.

- Development components of Audacious, BMP or XMMS are required to
  build their plugins. Most Linux distributions provide these as -devel
  or -dev packages.

- Plugins may need other development components, such as GTK+.


Building xmp
------------

In most systems just execute:

$ ./configure
$ make

If you wish to build the Audacious plugin, configure with:

$ ./configure --enable-audacious-plugin

Use --enable-bmp-plugin or --enable-xmms-plugin for BMP and XMMS.

To build the Winamp plugin, you need the Winamp SDK from http://winamp.com/.
If you want to cross-compile using MinGW, configure with:

$ ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-winamp-plugin

Many other options are available, run ./configure --help to list them.



Installation
------------

The xmp binary doesn't need a special installation procedure to run,
you can just copy src/main/xmp to an appropriate place. To install all
components run:

# make install

as the superuser. This will install the xmp executable, man page and
configuration files under /usr/local or a different location selected
with the --prefix option in configure.
