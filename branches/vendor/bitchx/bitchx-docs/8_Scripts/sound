Synopsis:
   load sound

Description:
   This script attempts to emulate the /sound command of mIRC.  When the
   client receives a CTCP SOUND request, it will attempt to play the
   sound file specified.  This requires that a variable $PLAYWAV be
   defined to the location of an external program that can play .wav
   files.  A sound may be sent with the /sound command:

     /sound <target>|* <wav file> [<action text>]

   If the target is "*", then the sound is sent to the current channel
   or query.

Other Notes:
   This script was written by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net, with
   some help from Tjerk Vonck on the semantics of the command.
