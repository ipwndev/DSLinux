Synopsis:
   load smileys

Description:
   This is a simple set of key bindings that print out smileys.  Nothing
   earth-shattering.  The author says he couldn't chat without them ;)

Bugs:
   Way back when this script was written, ^B meant inverse video, and ^_
   meant boldface.  Thus, the smileys won't be displayed as they were
   originally intended

Other Notes:
   This script was written by Carl von Loesch (lynx).
