Description:

   a nickname, and an integer (which is optional, the default is 2).
   It determines the address of the user, and replaces every 2 characters
   (or the number specified) with an asterisk (*), starting with the
   first.  A ban on the resultant pattern is then placed on the current
   channel.

   This script automatically loads the GUH script.  In the words of its
   author, this script is S L O W.
