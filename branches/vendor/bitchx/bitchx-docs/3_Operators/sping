Synopsis:
   sping <server>|<.>|<-clear>

Description:
   This form of ping is similar to the Unix ping command.  It tests the
   relative distance a server is from you on the Internet, which is useful
   for detecting the source of irc lag or netsplits. Without an arguement,
   sping will display the server pings it is currently waiting for. A
   server name of "." will use your current server. The arguement -CLEAR
   will clear the waiting server ping queue. This command is not restricted
   to irc operators and should work on ALL irc networks.
