Synopsis:
   who [<switch> [<arg>] [<switch> [<arg>] ...]] [<glob pattern>]

Description:
   The WHO command is used to retrieve detailed information about every
   user on irc.  For each user, it returns a single line containing
   their nickname, address (user@hostname), realname (IRCNAME), what
   their current channel is (and whether they have +o or +v there),
   whether they are marked away, and whether they are an irc operator.

   The data returned can be filtered by the client in a number of ways.
   It can be set to return only users who are marked away, people with a
   certain username, or users on a specific server.  For large queries,
   the data can also be conveniently dumped to a file for later viewing.
   
   The parameters to -end are as follows:
      $0   name of server queried
      $1   body of the query

Options:
   -operators            returns irc operators
   -lusers               returns non-irc operators
   -chops                returns channel operators
   -nick <nickname>      returns info for the given nickname only
   -name <username>      returns info for the given username only
   -host <hostname>      returns info for the given hostname only
   -server <servername>  returns info for the given servername only
   -diagnose             shows contents of the who queue for the server
                         of the current window
   -flush                removes all entries of the who queue for the server
                         of the current window
   -here                 returns users who are not away
   -away                 returns users who are away
   -line {...}           executes {...} for each line of output
   -end {...}            executes {...} at the end of the query
   -file <filename>      compare file contents to each line of output
   -u-i                  show invisible users (opers only, required
                         on the undernet)

Examples:
   To list all irc operators on servers from foo.com:
      /who -o -s *.foo.com

   To list the channel operators on channel #blah, which you are on:
      /who -c #blah

   To list all users from Russia, saving it to a file:
      /who -h *.ru -f ru.users

   To list all non-opers and say something at the end:
      /who -lusers -end { echo sheesh. that's alot of lusers! }

See Also:
   on(5) who; whois(2)

Restrictions:
   There are some limitations to the data returned by WHO.  For instance,
   it will not show users who have user mode +i set, unless that user's
   nickname is explicitly and unambiguously specified.  Similarly, it
   will mask channels with mode +p set, and will not show +s channels at
   all.  These limits do now apply, however, if the user in question is
   on a like channel with the querying client, or if the client is on a
   channel for which data is queried.

Other Notes:
   The various command line switches detailed above may be abbreviated,
   as shown in the examples, so line as the abbreviations are unambiguous.
   For instance, -n may not be used, since it matches -nick and -name.

   Use of the -file switch is not recommended, unless you know that the WHO
   output will be minimal.  This is because the client reads the entire file
   specified for each line of output, which is obviously quite inefficient,
   to say nothing of being rather abusing to your filesystem.

   The arguments from -line are identical to the arguments to on(5) who.
   In fact, -line works exactly like on(5) who. except it ALWAYS overrides
   on(5) who and disappears when the query is done. The -end is similar in
   that it overrides hooks to the 315 numeric.

   The -flush switch should *never* be used while a WHO request is still
   pending. The results are unpredictable. This is not a bug.
