Synopsis:
   $pid()
   $ppid()

Technical:
   This pair of functions return the client's current Unix process id, and
   its parent's process id, respectively.

Practical:
   These functions don't have much practical value.  One possible use might
   be to add a CTCP command that returns their values, allowing one to
   remotely kill a client that is responsive on the network, but not from
   the keyboard.

Returns:
   client process's pid/ppid

   exec(5)
