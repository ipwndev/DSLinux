Synopsis:
   $afterw(<word> <text>)
   $beforew(<word> <text>)

Technical:
   These functions return their input string, minus all words up to the
   given word ($beforew()) or following the given word ($afterw()).  They
   are analogous to $after() and $before(), operating on whole words
   instead of characters.  They search only for the first occurrence of the
   given word.

Practical:
   These return the part of the input text that is before or after the
   first instance of the given word.  This is probably most useful for
   internal parsing inside scripts; a variable might hold certain
   parameters, of which only certain ones might be useful at a particular
   time.  If the given word does not appear in the input text, nothing
   is returned.

Returns:
   afterw:  input list after first instance of given word
   beforew: input list before first instance of given word

Examples:
   $afterw(foobar one two foobar my shoe)    returns "my shoe"
   $afterw(booya one two foobar my shoe)     returns ""  (empty string)
   $beforew(foobar one two foobar my shoe)   returns "one two"
   $beforew(booya one two foobar my shoe)    returns ""  (empty string)
