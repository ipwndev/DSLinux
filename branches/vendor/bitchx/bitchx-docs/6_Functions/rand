Synopsis:
   $rand(<maximum>)

Technical:
   This function generates a pseudo-random number that no larger than the
   given maximum.  The $srand() function should be used first to reduce
   the predictability of the function.  If maximum is less than 1, the
   host's MAX_INT is used (the largest unsigned int it can handle); this
   maximum depends on the operating system and hardware platform of the
   host.

Practical:
   Random numbers have a seemingly endless list of possible uses.  Common
   ones for ircII and EPIC include picking some random, automated signoff
   message, connecting to a random server, etc.  Used with $crypt(),
   it can also be used to do some simple encryption.

Returns:
   random integer of range 0..maximum

Examples:
   $rand(50)             returns a random number no larger than 50
   $rand(-1)             returns a random number no larger than MAX_INT
   $rand()               returns nothing
