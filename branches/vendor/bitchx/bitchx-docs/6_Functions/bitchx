Synopsis:
   $bitchx()

Technical:
   Returns true if the client is an BitchX client.

Practical:
   If this function returns true, the client is an BitchX client, or some
   variant of it.  The $V and $J expandos will tell you the exact version
   of the client.  This function is necessary because the stock ircII
   client's value for $V and EPIC's overlap.  This is mostly a useful way
   for scripts to see if they can load or not.

Returns:
   > 0   client is an BitchX client
     0   client is not an BitchX client (should never happen)
