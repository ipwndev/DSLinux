Synopsis:
   $curpos()

Technical:
   Returns the offset of the cursor to the current window's input buffer.

Practical:
   There aren't many practical, everyday uses for this function.  One might
   use it to indicate when the user is nearing the end of the input line
   while typing (sort of like the bell on a typewriter).
