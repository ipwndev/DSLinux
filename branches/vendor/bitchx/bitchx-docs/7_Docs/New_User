                         NEW USER INFORMATION ABOUT IRC    

++ This file is for users new to irc.  Its intention is to briefly ++
++  describe what irc is all about.  It is not a command summary.  ++
++  Please refer to /help 7 introduction to get started with the ++
++                   various BitchX/EPIC commands.                 ++

Irc stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It is a networked, real-time, online
chat system.  Its popularity has grown enormously since its invention
more than 7 years ago, and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.
There are currently upwards of 30 irc "networks" scattered around the
Internet, serving every corner of the globe; do not expect everyone to
speak your own native language.  At any given time, there are usually
upwards of 60,000 people using the various established irc networks.

The primary means of identification on irc is currently the nickname.
All users have a nickname.  Your nickname can be changed with the /nick
command.  No two users on the same irc network may use the same nickname
at the same time.  For all intents and purposes, nicknames are NOT owned.
Anyone can use any nickname they like, including your favorite if you
aren't already using it on irc, and irc operators are under no obligation
whatsoever to "get it back" for you.  For this reason, it is recommended
that you use the /whois command if you are unsure if a nickname is someone
you know or not.

It is important to recognize the nature of irc.  Not everyone you meet
will be friendly and good-natured.  Just like in real life, you will meet
jerks, and other types you may not care to associate with.  You may meet
people who will try to deceive you.  In particular, you may run across
someone who will ask you to issue some commands.  USE CAUTION in these
situations.  If you don't know what the command does, don't do it.  If
the command involves the /on or /exec commands, don't do it unless you
are sure you know what you are doing.  If all else fails, ask an irc
operator or a help channel (such as #irchelp) for help.

One final note on commands.  The various BitchX commands can be
abbreviated (to the shortest possible unambiguous string).  For example,
/na would run the /names command.  This is mentioned because,
occasionally, you will run across pranksters trying to get new users to
type /sign or something similar (/sign is an abbreviation of /signoff).
As previously mentioned, use caution whenever anyone asks you to use a
command you are unfamiliar with or uncertain about.

Lastly, if you have not already done so, please read /help 7 etiquette
and /help 7 introduction.  The former describes the basic accepted
behavior on irc, while the latter is a beginning command rundown.
