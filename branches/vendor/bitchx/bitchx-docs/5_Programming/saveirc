Synopsis:
   saveirc [<options>]

Description:
   SAVEIRC is used to record the client's current configuration to an
   external file; if none is specified, the ~/.bitchxrc is used, or the name
   of the file specified on the command line with the -l switch.  The
   command does not save information such as nickname or user mode, or
   any setting that requires server interaction (except NOTIFY).

   The client by default will save all types of configurable settings to
   the external file.  It can be set, however, to only save certain
   types of settings.  The options may be abbreviated unambiguously.

Options:
   -alias        saves any aliases or alias structures present
   -assign       saves any variables or variable structures present
   -bind         saves any added key bindings
   -notify       saves the current NOTIFY list
   -on           saves all defined hooks
   -set          saves any modified SET variables
   -all          all of the above (default)

   -append       append to the end of the file, rather than overwriting
   -file <file>  save settings to the specified file

Examples:
   To save everything to a backup .bitchxrc:
      /saveirc -all -file ~/.bitchxrc.safe

   To only save internal variables and key bindings:
      /saveirc -b -s

Other Notes:
   This command will clobber any existing file it saves to.  Care should be
   taken to avoid unintentionally wiping an .bitchxrc that took days to write.
