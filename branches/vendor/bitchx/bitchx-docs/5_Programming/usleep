Synopsis:
   usleep <microseconds>

Description:
   This suspends the client for the specified number of microseconds. During
   this time, the client does absolutely nothing; it quite literally goes
   to sleep.  In general, it is most useful in non-interactive automated
   scripts, and even these cases are fairly rare.
