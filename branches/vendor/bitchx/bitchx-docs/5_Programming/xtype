   xtype [-literal] <text>

Description:
   XTYPE works just like TYPE, except that it may also take certain
   switches.  Currently, there is only one switch for XTYPE.

Options:
   -current   do not expand key bindings

Examples:
   To literally insert a control-a instead of having its meaning expanded:
      xtype -l now inserting a ^A is easy!
