Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]input [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever a command is entered on the input line,
   or when text is sent to a channel or query.

   This is a very powerful mechanism of the client.  Used intelligently,
   it permits a very fine degree of control over the text entered on the
   input line.  Used carelessly, and it can easily disable the client.
   Use with caution.

   If a silent hook is set, one can use a loaded script to do preprocessing
   of the input line.

Parameters:
   $0-   text of input line entered

Examples:
   To emulate the INPUT_ALIASES setting:
      on ^input "*" {
         eval $*
      }
