Synopsis:
   do <commands>
   do { <commands> } [while (<condition>)]

Description:
   In its base form, DO behaves much like EVAL.  It evaluates its input
   once, then executes it.  It is superior in some respects, however.  For
   instance, it can cope with complex commands (multiple commands within
   curly braces).

   Furthermore, DO has the ability to mimic the WHILE command.  While the
   operation is not identical, it is similar.  It only differs in that the
   condition is evaluated after each loop iteration, so the loop is
   guaranteed to run for at least one iteration.

See Also:
   To force expansion of some variable $foo:
      /do echo the variable $$foo expands to $foo

   To run the same command in indefinite number of times, but at least once:
      assign blah 2
      do {
         echo $blah is lower than 3
      }
      while ( blah = rand(5) < 3 )

See Also:
   eval(5); while(5)

Other Notes:
   This command is mostly supported for compatibility with previous ircII
   clients.  Internally, it uses more resources than EVAL, so it isn't of
   much practical use, save for its looping ability.
