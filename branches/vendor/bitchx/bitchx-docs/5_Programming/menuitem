   menuitem <menu name> <options> <optional refnum> "Menu Text" { code }

Description:
   MENUITEM Appends a menuitem to the end of the specified menu.  
   The possible options are: 
        -f = framed (PM only - draws a thin line around the text)
        -s = static (unselectable)
        -d = default (PM only - conditional cascade menus)
        -b = break (starts a new vertical line)
   The optional refnum is used for setting checks on menuitems.
   The menu text is what shows up on the menu.  If you put "separator"
   instead of menu text a horizontal break will be created. Place
   a ~ before a character in the menu text to make an accellerator out
   of that key. (i.e. ALT-character will select that menu item)
   Code is a code fragment to be executed when this menu item 
   is selected.
