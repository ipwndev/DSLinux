Synopsis:
   redirect <nick>|*|<channel>|%<process>|=<nick> <command>

Description:
   This lets you send the output of any command to another user or
   channel.  You can even send the output to a running subprocess (a
   pipeline, in a sense).  Redirecting output across a DCC connection
   is allowed.  A "*" may be specified as the target, which is
   interpreted as your current channel.  Like MSG and NOTICE, multiple
   targets are permitted; separate them with commas.

   There is an implicit WAIT built into the REDIRECT command, meaning the
   client will send all of the output of the command to the target before
   it does anything else.  See WAIT for more information.

Examples:
   To send the output of a WHOIS to channel #blah:
      /redirect #blah whois foobar

   To send the output of a USERHOST to a running subprocess:
      /redirect %finger userhost foobar

   To send the current topic to JoeBob and JimBob:
      /redirect joebob,jimbob topic #blah
