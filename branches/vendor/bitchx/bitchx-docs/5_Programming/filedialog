Description:
   FILEDIALOG creates a file selection dialog based on the options
   passed.  Possible options:
        O = open dialog
        S = save as dialog
        M = allow multiple selections
        A = include apply button (PM only)
   The initial path if not specified is the current directory. In some
   cases COMMENT_BREAKAGE should be set off.  Problems will occur when
   something like ~/*.mp3 is specified because /* gets interpretted 
   as a comment.
   Dialog title is the text that is displayed in the dialog's titlebar.
   Ok button and Apply button text is displayed on the corresponding 
   buttons if possible.
   Code is the code fragment which is run after a selection is made.
   $0 is OK, CANCEL or APPLY based on the user's choice. $1 and on are 
   the filenames selected, can be more than one in the case of multiple
   selection.
