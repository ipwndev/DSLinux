Synopsis:
   hook <anything>

Description:
   HOOK is used for one thing only; to activate a HOOK hook.  Don't worry
   if that didn't make much sense.  The client has a mechanism by which
   an arbitrary hook may be defined that can be hooked at any time by
   the HOOK command.  The hook is created just like any other named
   hook, except only the HOOK command may trigger it.

Examples:
   This script will echo a line every 10 seconds:
      on ^hook "foo" {
         timer 10 {
            echo This line is repeated every 10 seconds
            hook foo
         }
      }
      hook foo

Other Notes:
   The same functionality of HOOK can be obtained with normal aliases.
   However, use of HOOK is preferred as it avoids the need for recursive
   aliases (which have been known to cause trouble).
