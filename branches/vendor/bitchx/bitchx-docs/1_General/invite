Synopsis:
   invite <nickname> <channel>

Description:
   This command lets you invite people to a one of your current channels.
   This is generally used on channels that are +i (meaning people can only
   join if someone INVITEs them; see MODE for more information on channel
   modes), but this is not a restriction.

Examples:
   To invite foobar to channel #blah:
      /invite foobar #blah

   To join the last channel you were INVITEd to:
      /join -invite
