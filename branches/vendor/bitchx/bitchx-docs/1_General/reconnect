Synopsis:
   reconnect [<reason>]

Description:
   This causes the client to disconnect from the current server and
   immediately reconnect.  The net effect is the same as that of using
   DISCON (or DISCONNECT) and then SERVER with the previous server name
   or number.

   RECONNECT is often useful for changing your REALNAME (the same as
   your $IRCNAME environment variable, if set).  As with QUIT, you may give
   a signoff reason.

See Also:
   discon(1); disconnect(1); realname(4); server(1); set(4) realname

Restrictions:
   RECONNECT does not allow you to specify which server to reconnect to,
   if you are connected to more than one.
