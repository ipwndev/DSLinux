Synopsis:
   dcc raw <fd> <host> <message>

Description:
   DCC RAW is a raw socket interface for ircII-EPIC.  It allows the client
   to control arbitrary TCP connections with a remote host on any port
   desired.

   The actual connection is established with the $connect() function.  It
   makes the connection and returns a file descriptor that is used by DCC
   RAW to control the connection.  The file descriptor will always be a
   number (generally a small one).  Incoming data from the remote host may
   be hooked with ON DCC_RAW.

Examples:
   To send a message to blah.foo.com over an existing raw DCC connection:
      /dcc raw 6 blah.foo.com This is a sample message

See Also:
   connect(6); listen(6); on(5) dcc_raw

Other Notes:
   The applications for DCC RAW are endless.  Since it allows the client
   connect to any arbitrary host on any arbitrary port, a little creative
   use of the scripting language can turn ircII-EPIC into a client for
   most any remote service.
