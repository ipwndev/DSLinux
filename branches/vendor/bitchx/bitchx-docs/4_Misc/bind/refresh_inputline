Synopsis:
   bind <key> refresh_inputline

Description:
   This function causes the client to redraw the input line.  It is mostly
   only useful when another process sends data to the client's tty, which
   sometimes corrupts the display of the input line (but not the actual
   contents).

   This command is mostly deprecated, as REFRESH_SCREEN takes care of the
   input line, as well as the rest of the screen.  It is only really useful
   for times when it may not be wise to refresh the rest of the screen,
   such as if there were special ANSI escape sequences in the display
   window or status bar.  This is rarely the case, though.
