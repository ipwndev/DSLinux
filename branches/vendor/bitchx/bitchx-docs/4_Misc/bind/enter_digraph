Synopsis:
   bind <key> enter_digraph

Description:
   This function allows special characters not present on the keyboard to
   be composed, such as European characters containing accents, umlauts,
   or tildes.  The exact characters available are dependent on the
   character set in use by the client.

   To enter a digraph, the key bound to this function is typed, followed
   by the desired character pair.

   In order for the client to properly display these characters, the
   appropriate character map must be used; the default ASCII translation
   table will not work.  Additionally, the client must be set to pass 8
   bit characters (also disabled by default).

   By default, EPIC uses the same digraphs as available on the DEC vt320
   and vt420 terminal emulators, and those used in the Elvis text editor.
   The DIGRAPH command with no arguments will list the current table.
