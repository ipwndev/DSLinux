Synopsis:
   bind <key> command_completion

Description:
   This function attempts to complete a command name used on the input
   line, much like modern Unix shells do.  It can expand both builtin
   commands and aliases.  It only attempts to expand the first word on
   the input line, and only if it is prefixed by the command character,
   and thus unlike Unix shells, the cursor does not need to be near the
   command name to expand it.
