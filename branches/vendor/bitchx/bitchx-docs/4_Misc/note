Synopsis:
   note <command> [&<password>] [+|-<flags>] [<arguments>]

Description:
   NOTE is a sort of turbo-charged messaging system for irc.  In short, it
   achieves at the server level what the client attempts to do with MSG
   and NOTIFY.  The messaging system resembles modern voice mail systems
   (except in text); messages can be sent, stored, or set for deferred
   delivery.  The client notification system works like NOTIFY, except
   with greater accuracy and flexibility.

   The most common uses of NOTE are its SPY and SEND functions.  SPY is
   similar to NOTIFY, except it can accept a full address to spy on, not
   just a nickname.  SEND, as its name implies, sends a note to a user; if
   that user is not currently online, it will be delivered if the user logs
   onto irc within a set time period.

   When referring to a particular user, NOTE can deal with the standard
   nick!user@host notation.  Wildcards are allowed, and any portion may be
   omitted, so long as the identifier remains unambiguous.

Examples:
   To send a note to Joebob (whose account is jbriggs@drivein.com):
      /note send joebob!jbriggs@drivein.com Hey there!  Great movie!

   To spy on anyone from blah.com for the next 30 days:
      /note spy +30 *!*@*.blah.com A blah.com user is active

Aliases:
   Most NOTE commands are aliases to NOTE USER with certain flags applied.

See Also:
   msg(1); notice(1); notify(1)

Restrictions:
   NOTE is not available everywhere.  It is used primarily on Undernet,
   though even there it is not fully deployed.  No servers on EFnet are
   known to support NOTE.  There is much debate over whether the usefulness
   of NOTE outweighs its potential for invasion of privacy, to say nothing
   of it requiring enough server resources to make its use prohibitive.  A
   discussion of the various NOTE commands is beyond the scope of these
   help files.

Other Notes:
   NOTE was originally developed in 1990 by jarle@stud.cs.uit.no (Wizible
   on irc).  Wizible is the authoritative source of information for this
   command.
