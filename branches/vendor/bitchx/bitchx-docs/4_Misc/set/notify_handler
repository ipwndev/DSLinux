Synopsis:
   set notify_handler [<old|quiet|noisy>]

Description:
   This setting controls when the client will report a signon or signoff
   for a user in the notify list.  The normal behavior is to check for
   every nickname in the list at set intervals.  This setting allows the
   client to internally register a signon (or signoff) based on other
   information that would clearly indicate it, such as a JOIN or QUIT.

Options:
   noisy   trigger NOTIFY on JOINs, SIGNOFFs, and 401 numerics
   old     normal behavior from stock 2.2.x ircII clients
   quiet   only trigger NOTIFY on WHOIS+ and ISON output

Other Notes:
   The OLD and QUIET settings function the same.  It is uncertain whether
   this is the intended behavior.
