Synopsis:
   set notify_interval <seconds>

Description:
   This determines how often the notify list is sent to the server to be
   checked.

See Also:
   away(1); bind(4) send_line

Other Notes:
   This value does not change the client's default behavior of checking the
   notify list on the top of every minute, however, it does change how many
   minutes will skip checking the list. For this variable, a multiple of 60
   is advised, and a value less than 60 will be ignored.
