Synopsis:
   set mail [<0|1|2>]

Description:
   This setting affects how the client checks for new mail.  When set to
   0 (zero), mail checking is disabled.  When set to 1 (one), the client
   will periodically report how many new messages have arrived since the
   last check, and the total message count.  When set to 2 (two), the
   client shows the sender and subject of each new message as well.

Other Notes:
   The client will only search for new mail in the user's mail spool.  The
   mail spool directory location is hardcoded into the client at compile
   time.
