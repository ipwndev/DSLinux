Synopsis:
   set auto_reconnect_delay <seconds>

Description:
   When you are kill(3)ed or disconnected from a server unexpectedly,
   the client will automatically reconnect <seconds> seconds after the
   disconnect.

Bugs:
   This only reconnects you to the current window, so if a server in a
   non-current window disconnects, auto_reconnect will fail. This is arguably
   a bug, and may be fixed sometime in a later version.
