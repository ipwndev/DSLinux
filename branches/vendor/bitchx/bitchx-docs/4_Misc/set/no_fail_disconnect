Synopsis:
   set no_fail_disconnect [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When this is set ON, the client will not automatically try to reconnect
   when a write() to a server fails. This is mostly only useful in situations
   like mine, where you have a dialup static IP where packets are retained
   when you are disconnected. This means that a person with a static IP can
   set this ON, disconnect from the ISP, reconnect to the ISP, and never
   leave irc.
