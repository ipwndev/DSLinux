Synopsis:
   window bind <channel|chan1,chan2>

Description:
   This binds the specified channel(s) to the client's current window.  This
   means that all channel traffic for the channel(s) will now be dumped to
   this window.  This is useful if you join a channel in one window, but
   then wish to put it in another window. NOTE. This command is differant
   than the ircII/epic commands in that we accept multiple comma separated
   channels for binding to a window.

   BIND does not require that the client already be on the channel to
   be bound, and it will not join the channel if it is not already on it.
   Use WINDOW CHANNEL to join the channel.  Also note that leaving the
   channel does not unbind it from the window; WINDOW UNBIND must be used.
