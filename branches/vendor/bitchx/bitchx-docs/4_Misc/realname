Synopsis:
   realname [<text>]

Description:
   REALNAME is used to set the client's IRCNAME (hence the alias, below).
   The IRCNAME is an arbitrary text string that is displayed in WHOIS and
   WHO output.  Typically it contains the user's real name, but it may
   contain anything the user desires.  Use of this command will override
   any previous setting to REALNAME, as well as the $IRCNAME environment
   variable (if set).

Aliases:
   IRCNAME is functionally equivalent to REALNAME.

See Also:
   Environment(7); reconnect(1); set(4) realname

Restrictions:
   This command does not change the IRCNAME on the fly.  The client must
   disconnect and reconnect to a server before it will take effect.
