	* added support for opennap server commands.
	* added support for opennap soundex searching. This means we can
          search for something which may be spelled incorrectly or where we 
	  don't know the exact spelling.  /nsound is the command. It is used
	  exactly like /nsearch
	* added support for opennap mime-type searching. When specifying a
	  type, all other params are ignored, except max_results.
		/nsearch -type video matrix
		
01-17-00 
	* gratitious change to napster windows client involving the md5
          checksum. Seems we need to send the filesize at the end of the
	  md5. "md5-filesize"
	* Added /nload -load which will load a ~/.BitchX/shared.dat. This
	  file is in the same format as the linux client.
	* Added /nload -save which will save/overwrite the shared.dat.
	* firewall get's are fixed.
	* removed SO_LINGER on a file send. why should we wait for the other
          end to catch up.

01-11-00 0.7
	* when a file get returns "FILE NOT SHARED" we need to use += on the
	  read
	* Changed the queued get to actually queue the file instead of
	  deleting the request.
	* Changed socket's to SO_LINGER. Maybe this'll fix firewall get's.

12-20-99 0.6c
	* md5 only calculated on 300k. do NOT include the id3v1 or id3v2 tag. 
	  Also it seems that MusicMatch uses id3v2 (lame piece of shit, why
	  make something so complicated as id3v2), So we have to skip the
	  id3v2 header while calculating it. Also noticed was that a file
	  had BOTH id3v1 and id3v2 headers. Like, give us a break. Use one 
	  or the other, not both.

12-19-99
	* void noticed that /nscan was not working. Turns out my
	  nap_current_channel and njoin routines were a little screwy. njoin
	  should not "remove" the channel from our internal list.
	* fudd helped me find a problem with file sends.. needed to be a
	  little less optimistic about when data is available for reading.
	* added /necho command. accepts a -x arg, which places text without
	  the prompt.
	* found another possible coredump problem in filesends.
	* added auto-reconfigure dataport.
	* colorized speed of connection in the names and scan list. Also
	  joins and parts. bright green is fastest, dark grey is unknown.
	
12-15-99
	* found/fixed firewall sends. IT should work as long as the other
	  end is okay. It does seem however that on occasion the other end
	  fails and odd errors will pop up.
	* found the send limit numerics.
	* found remove file numeric.
	* added support for data port misconfigurations.
	* modified tab_completion() so that tab key will work for nmsg.
	* fixed lost sockets.
	* fixed download coredump.
	* made certain /set's send the appropriate napster command.
	* merged all the admin commands into /nadmin
	* added several functions for scripting. 
		$mp3time(seconds) pretty prints the time.
		$nonchan(chan) returns if we are on the specified channel
		$nonchannel(chan [nick]) returns ALL nicks or just nick
		$napconnected() returns the server/port
		$ntopic(chan) topic for the channel
		$ncurrent() returns the current "client" channel
		$nhotlist([nick]) returns the whole hotlist or whether 
			nick is online
		$nraw(# string) will send "raw" commands to the server.
		$md5(# [size]) will md5 checksum a open file # using 300000
			as the default size or whatever you specify.
			@f = open(filename R)
			@md = md5(f)
			close(f)
	* started adding firewall download support. (does this even work ??)
	
12-13-99
	* Fixed more cores.
	* Found more numerics... Almost complete.
	* Found "resume" semantics..
	* Added "hooks" for scripting.
	* Whois info is updated with number of file sends/gets
	* Added channel save between connects. We now re-join any channels we
	  were in when the server dumps us.
	* Fudd found a problem when the filesend does not complete, but a
	  msg saying it did, appears	
	* Should compile for cygwin now as well.
	* new commands added. /nemail, /ndataport, /nlinespeed etc.
		?? should these be removed in favour of the /set's

12-12-99
	* Server connection errors detected earlier.
	* Server read error caught.
	* Hotlist fixes.
