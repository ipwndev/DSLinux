First public release of a dll-ized version of my TCL acromania script.
You need the BitchX include files for it to compile (duh).
Seems to work fine in testing, alert me of any problems.

                    ************ WARNING ************
DO NOT /UNLOADDLL WHILE A GAME IS IN PROGRESS, YOUR CLIENT WILL CORE!
If you MUST stop a game in progress, FIRST KILL THE TIMER(S) and unload it.
Maybe panasync will take these race conditions into account someday :)...
                    ************ WARNING ************


Greetz to (in NO particular order) dh, hammz, scoop, hammz, oweff, shewp
ice-man, sideshow, BlackJac, fudd, shade, psykotyk, MHacker, Sheik, easyme
macker, |Fingers|, mrr, Timer, and anyone else I'm forgetting (let me know)

Major super-kudo greets to panasync, without his help I never would have got
this working properly, and of course for making bX in the first place.. =)
