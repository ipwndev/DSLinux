Quite a bit borrowed from the napster module written by panasync. 
libtoc (backened) was written (put together) by me also, and is mostly
composed of code from gaim (see freshmeat).

bx.patch is a small patch to modify bx to allow custom module completion
routines. If not patched, just remove -DBITCHX_PATCH from CFLAGS in the
Makefile
