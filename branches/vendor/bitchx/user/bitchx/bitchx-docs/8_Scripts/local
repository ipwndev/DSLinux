Synopsis:
   load local

Description:
   This script is meant for use by local administrators of the client.  It
   is (supposed to be) loaded automatically from GLOBAL when the client is
   started.

   At the time of this writing, the script first informs the user of which
   client is being used, it's version, who to contact for trouble, etc.
   It loads the DISC and GUH scripts, and sets the translation table to
   LATIN_1.  It also supplies a function, $locdomain(), which returns true
   if the input hostname has the same domain as the client's.

Other Notes:
   This script is distributed as "local.examp" in an attempt to make local
   administrators tailor it to their needs, instead of loading it blindly.
