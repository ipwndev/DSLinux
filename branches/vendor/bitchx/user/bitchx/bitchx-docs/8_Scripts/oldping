Synopsis:
   load oldping

Description:
   This is a script version of the now-ubiquitous CTCP PING command.  It is
   necessary when dealing with other clients that are particularly old, or
   that do not otherwise support CTCP PING (but do support other CTCP
   commands).  It works by sending the ping message in a CTCP ERRMSG, which
   most clients will reply to.  It otherwise works just like PING, except
   the command is /oping.

Other Notes:
   This script has been contributed to by numerous people.  Credit for the
   original idea goes to Robey Pointer (Robey), robey@netcom.com, with some
   inspiration from Klaus Zeuge (sojge), sojge@minsk.docs.uu.se, and
   Nicolas Pioch (Nap), pioch@poly.polytecnique.fr.  Some credit also goes
   to Peter Hellmonds (snoopy), hellmond@phoenix.princeton.edu.  Ian
   Frechette (Daemon), frechett@spot.colorado.edu, made the necessary
   modifications for it to run under ircII 2.2pre6.  Further modifications
   have been made by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net, for EPIC.
