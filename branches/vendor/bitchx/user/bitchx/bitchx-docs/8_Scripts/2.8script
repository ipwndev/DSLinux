Synopsis:
   load 2.8script

Description:
   This is one of the default script loaded when the client is started; it
   is loaded from GLOBAL.  It redefines the returned messages from STATS
   queries and in channel ban lists.  It contains several aliases; those
   whose names are the same as builtin commands are intended to enhance
   them.

     Alias     Description                                                
     /cinfo    reports who compiled client -> $info(c)
     /invite   channel name optional
     /join     channel prefix optional, no args follows last invite
     /leave    channel prefix optional, no args leaves current
     /mode3    unlimited number of arguments to single mode
     /topic    channel name optional, channel prefix optional

Examples:
   To join channels #foo, #bar, and &blah:
      /join foo,bar,&blah

   To give channel mode +o to your 5 best friends in #blah:
      /mode3 #blah +ooo joebob jimbob junebug orville wilbur

   To set the topic on the curent channel:
      /topic Welcome to our channel!

   stats(2); topic(1)

Bugs:
   The /mode3 alias requires that the mode to be set contain a triple mode,
   if 3 or more people are to receive the mode.  For instance, the script
   would partially fail if '+o' were used in the above example.
