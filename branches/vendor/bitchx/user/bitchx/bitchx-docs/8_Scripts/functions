Synopsis:
   load functions

Description:
   This script contains several functions useful in scripting for text
   display.  Of primary interest are $format() and $lformat().  They
   behave similarly to using the $[]var notation, except they will not
   truncate text that is wider than the specified width.

   Also included are $pluck(), $notword(), and $remove(), which are really
   just aliases to EPIC's builtin functions $remw(), $notw(), and $remw()
   (again).

   Refer to Section 6 of the help files for more information on the
   myriad functions built into the client.

Other Notes:
   Originally, this script contained many more functions, and a number of
   aliases.  Though still present in the script source code, they are
   commented out, as they have been obsoleted by builtin capabilities of
   the client.  The original functions were authored by Ian Frechette
   (Daemon), frechett@spot.colorado.edu.
