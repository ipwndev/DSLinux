Synopsis:
   load netsplit.env

Description:
   This is easily among the most well-known, and is probably one of the
   most-stolen, scripts available for ircII.  It attempts to cut down on
   the excess "noise" produced during a netsplit.  Instead of seeing a
   potential flood of signoff and rejoin messages, everything is condensed
   into a single message for the netsplit, and a single message for the
   netjoin.  All information is saved, so the user can still see who was
   lost in the netsplit.  Several commands are provided:

     Command       Description                                            
     /bogusclear   purge the list of bogus server patterns
     /boguslist    display the list of bogus server patterns
     /boguspat     add one or more new bogus server patterns
     /netpurge     clean out data about old netsplits
     /wholeft      should who left in the most recent netsplit

Other Notes:
   This script was primarily written by Ian Frechette (Daemon), including
   version VII, the most recent revision.  Significant modifications to
   previous versions (version V in particular) were made by poxaV,
   cgw@unt.edu.
