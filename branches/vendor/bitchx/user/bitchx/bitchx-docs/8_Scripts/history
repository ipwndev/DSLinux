Synopsis:
   load history

Description:
   This clever script allows for special escape sequence to be used inside
   the current input line.  The sequences refer to the previous line
   entered on the input line.  The binding ^k-h may be used to toggle the
   history function on and off.

     Escape         Description                                           
     !$             expands to the last word in the previous line
     !0 !1 ... !9   expand to the first ten words in the last line entered
     !*             expands to all but the first word in the previous line

Examples:
   To ban an abusive user from several channels:
      /mode #channel1 +b *!*jerk@*.lusers.com
      /mode #channel2 +b !$
      !0 #channel3 !2 !3
