Synopsis:
   help [<topic> [<subtopic> ...]]

Description:
   As its name implies, HELP is the command for getting help with some
   feature of the client.  Currently, the EPIC help system divides the
   various help documents up into logical groups, each group is given a
   unique section number.

   Help files are uniformly structured.  All files include, at the very
   least, a synopsis and description (such as this file).  Some files
   also include a description of switches accepted by the command, a
   list of aliases to the command, bug warnings, or other miscellaneous
   information.

   Some also include a list of related help topics.  These references are
   usually followed by a number in parentheses.  This number is the help
   section that the command is listed under.  Help file names are not
   sensitive to case (e.g. "HELP" is the same as "help"), and they may be
   abbreviated unambiguously (e.g. "hel" is the same as "help", but "wh"
   is ambiguous because it matches "who", "whois", "whowas", etc.).

Options:
   -wait        this will stop script processing until the user is finished
                in the help system

Examples:
   To get help on the WHOIS command (in section 3):
      /help 3 whois

   To list all of the help files in section 3 (server queries):
      /help 3 ?

   To list all help sections:
      /help
