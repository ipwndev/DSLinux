Synopsis:
   addidle [#chan seconds]

Description:
   This command will add idle checking to a channel. It will kick
   MAX_IDLEKICKS nicks at a time after the number of seconds specified 
   for the idle time has elapsed. This can cause problems if mass kick
   protection is active on the channel. Various things will make the client
   think that another nick is not idle, publics, notices and ctcps for 
   example will reset the timer for the nick doing them. You will not
   kick yourself, another op or a voiced client as long as the channel set
   for KICK_OPS is off. Also if the nick is on your userlist then you will
   not kick them

Examples:
   To add idle checking to a channel:
      /addidle #channel 600
