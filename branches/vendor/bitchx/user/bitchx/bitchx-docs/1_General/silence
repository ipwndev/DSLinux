Synopsis:
   silence [[+|-]<nick!user@host>]
   silence [<nick>]

Description:
   SILENCE is similar in many respects to IGNORE, except that it is
   server-based.  What this means is the server will never even send you
   messages from anyone you have SILENCEd, whereas it will with IGNORE,
   where your client is responsible for filtering the messages out.  This
   has the advantage of not bogging your client down with excessive data
   as it tries to filter out messages.

   The default behavior is to SILENCE a nick!user@host pattern, and if
   such a pattern is not passed as the argument, it must be prepended with
   a plus ('+') to be added to your silence list.  If a pattern is prepended
   with a minus ('-'), it will be removed from your silence list.  If you
   only specify a nickname, you can list the patterns in the silence list
   owned by that nickname.  If no arguments are given, your own silence list
   is displayed.

Options:
   +   add a pattern to your silence list
   -   remove a pattern from your silence list

Examples:
   To add someone to your silence list:
      /silence *!*jerk@*.moron.org

   To remove someone from your silence list:
      /silence -*!*friend@*.bestbuds.com

   To see the silence list for FooBar:
      /silence foobar

   EFnet).
