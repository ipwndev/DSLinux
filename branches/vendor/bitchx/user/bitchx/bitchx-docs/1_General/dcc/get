Synopsis:
   dcc get [=]<nick> [<file>]

Description:
   DCC GET initiates a file transfer with a remote client that has offered
   the client a DCC SEND.  Naturally, a remote client must have already
   send the client a DCC SEND request in order for the client to start a
   DCC GET with it.  If the DCC request comes over an existing DCC CHAT
   connection, a '=' must be prepended to the nickname.

   The client need not specify the name of the file to get.  If multiple
   files are offered by the same remote client, the oldest SEND request
   is processed first.

Examples:
   To accept a SEND from joebob:
      /dcc get joebob

   To accept all files offered to you by DCCbot:
      /dcc get DCCbot *
