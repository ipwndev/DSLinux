Synopsis:
   dcc reget [=]<nick> [<file>]

Description:
   DCC REGET initiates a file transfer with a remote client that has 
   offered the client a DCC RESEND.  Naturally, a remote client must have 
   already send the client a DCC RESEND request in order for the client to 
   start a DCC REGET with it.  If the DCC request comes over an existing 
   DCC CHAT connection, a '=' must be prepended to the nickname.

   This command resumes the file if it exists. It is not compatible with
   mIRC.

   The client need not specify the name of the file to get.  If multiple
   files are offered by the same remote client, the oldest RESEND request
   is processed first.

Examples:
   To accept a RESEND from joebob:
      /dcc reget joebob

   To accept all files offered to you by DCCbot:
      /dcc reget DCCbot *
