Synopsis:
   dcc [<command> [<arguments>]]

Description:
   DCC stands for direct client-to-client.  The DCC command handles all
   such connections.  There are two primary uses for DCC; bypassing the
   irc network for chatting, and file transfers.  However, this is not
   the limit of DCC's capabilities.

   DCC connections are established with CTCP handshakes.  All this really
   means is that connection request, connection, and rejection messages
   are sent in CTCP format.  This is noteworthy, as other commands that
   operate based on message type will lump DCC messages in with CTCPs
   (including IGNORE and the client's internal logging mechanisms).

Aliases:
   Using DCC with no arguments is the same as DCC LIST.

See Also:
   ctcp(1); on(5) dcc_connect, dcc_lost, dcc_request

Restrictions:
   It is worth noting that users behind firewalls may have some problems
   using DCC.  Depending on the nature of the firewall, such users will
   probably be unable to initiate a DCC SEND.  Others may find that they
   cannot use DCC at all.  This is not a bug in ircII-EPIC, it is due
   simply to matters beyond the control of the client program.
