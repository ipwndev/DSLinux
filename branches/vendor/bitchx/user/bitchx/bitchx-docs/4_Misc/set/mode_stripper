Synopsis:
   set mode_stripper [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client can make use of the MODE_STRIPPED hook.
   This essentially breaks down complex mode changes into single mode
   changes, making each individual mode change easier to process and
   act upon.  This only affects the display of the modes, and it does
   not interfere with the MODE hook.
