Synopsis:
   set max_recursions [<number>]

Description:
   This setting limits the number of times a function or alias can call
   itself before returning or exiting.  This is a safety precaution to
   prevent the client from looping infinitely.  Setting this variable to
   0 (zero) effectively disables alias recursion.
