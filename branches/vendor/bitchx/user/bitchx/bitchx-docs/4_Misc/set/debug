Synopsis:
   set debug [<level>]

Description:
   When turned on, this variable enables various degrees of debugging
   while the client is running.  It is useful for seeing precisely where
   a particular alias or function is failing, what variables are being
   assigned what values, etc.  There are three general classes of debug
   output, each assigned a unique number.

      Bit  Value   Purpose
       0     1     displays all commands executed, including aliases
       1     2     displays all actual alias and variable substitutions
       2     4     displays all function calls and their return values

   Multiple classes may be displayed at once by adding the desired
   values together.  A setting of 0 (zero) turns off debugging.

Examples:
   To show all commands executed and alias expansion:
      /set debug 3

   To show everything:
      /set debug 7

See Also:
   set(4) hold_mode

Other Notes:
   This command can generate a lot of output, so setting HOLD_MODE on is
   recommended.
