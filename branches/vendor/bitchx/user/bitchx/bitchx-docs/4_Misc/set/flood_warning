Synopsis:
   set flood_warning [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will display a message to the user to that
   effect (who is flooding, what type, etc.).  If off, the client does
   not warn the user that flood protection has kicked in, unless a custom
   message is returned from within the FLOOD hook.
