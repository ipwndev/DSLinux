Synopsis:
   set show_end_of_msgs [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting causes the client to display messages from
   the server indicating that a command's output has completed.  This is
   mostly useful for commands, such as NAMES or LIST, that can generate
   quite a bit of output.  It is also useful for determining if a command
   generated any output at all.
