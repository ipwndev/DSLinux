Synopsis:
   set help_window [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting will cause the client to create a new
   window to display help files in when HELP is used.  The window creation
   will obey the ALWAYS_SPLIT_BIGGEST setting.  The window will be killed
   when the user is finished using help.

   If off, the client will display the help in the current window.

See Also:
   help(1); set(4) always_split_biggest, help_prompt

Bugs:
   This setting does not work well when HELP_PROMPT is turned off, as it
   will end the HELP command immediately, this killing the new window
   immediately.
