Synopsis:
   set status_user [<text>]

Description:
   This variable is user-definable.  The text that is assigned to it is
   displayed in the status bar as %U (or %0, see below).  The expando is
   treated literally inside STATUS_USER, and has no special meaning.
   This variable is provided so the user can make arbitrary information
   available in the status bar.

Examples:
   Setting some custom string for the status bar:
      /set status_user Client configured by IRC Systems, Inc.

Aliases:
   There are actually 9 additional user-definable variables, STATUS_USER1
   through STATUS_USER9.  Each has a unique expando, %1 to %9.
