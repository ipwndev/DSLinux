Synopsis:
   set color [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will parse ^C color codes as used by several
   GUI clients (ircle, mIRC). This requires a compile-time option in config.h
   to be defined. The default is OFF. When OFF, color codes will be filtered
   out of all output, and their color values ignored.
