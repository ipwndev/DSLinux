Synopsis:
   set dcc_store_path [<path>]

Description:
   This sets the default directory to store files retrieved with DCC GET.
   Naturally, the client must have write permissions in the chosen
   directory for it to work properly (the client will not warn if it has
   insufficient access).  The default is to save the file to the current
   directory.
