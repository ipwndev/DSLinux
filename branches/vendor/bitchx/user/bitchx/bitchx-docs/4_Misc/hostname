Synopsis:
   hostname <address>

Description:
   This command has two related, though distinct, purposes.  The first is
   mostly of interest to users whose ip addresses may change mid-session,
   or those who are behind a firewall.  It allows the user to specify the
   hostname or ip address to use for DCC connections.

   The second use is only of interest to users on machines with multiple
   network interfaces, such as multi-homed sites.  It allows the user to
   force the client to bind to a particular network address that the host
   has.  If no address is given, the client uses the address for the
   host's primary network interface.  A default hostname or ip address
   may be set in the IRCHOST environment variables.  The client must
   reconnect to a server for the setting to take effect.

Aliases:
   IRCHOST is equivalent in function to HOSTNAME.

See Also:
   Environment(7); dcc(1); reconnect(1)

Other Notes:
   The client may not bind to addresses that the current host does not
   specifically handle; the client does no sanity checking for such host
   names or ip addresses, and irc servers will ignore them.  The client
   must reconnect to a server before the setting will take effect.
