Synopsis:
   mlist <menu name> [<menu name> ...]

Description:
   This command is used to list the contents of the specified menu.  More
   than one menu may be listed at once.  If the menu name contains spaces
   (which they are allowed to), the name must be surrounded by double
   quotes (").

See Also:
   Menus(7); bind(4) enter_menu; mload(4); set(4) menu

Bugs:
    MLIST does not react well if a specified menu name has not been
    loaded (or does not otherwise exist).  For this reason, special care
    must be taken when listing menu names with spaces in them.
