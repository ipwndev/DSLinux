Synopsis:
   digraph [-<flag> [<arg0> <arg1> [<arg2>]]]

Description:
   DIGRAPH allows you to maintain your client's internal digraph table.
   A digraph is a series of keystrokes that are used to represent other
   characters that may not physically be available on your keyboard
   (such as the British pound sign on U.S. keyboards).  To actually
   enter a digraph, a key must be bound to ENTER_DIGRAPH, which then
   makes the client interpret the next two characters as the desired
   special character.

   If no arguments are given to DIGRAPH, the current digraph table is
   shown.  Depending on the flag given, digraphs may be added, deleted,
   or the entire digraph table may be cleared.  If the SAVE command is
   used, any changes made to the client's default internal digraph
   table are saved in your .ircrc file.

Options:
   -add     This takes 3 arguments, the two characters to type to get
              the digraph, and the digraph itself.  Any of the 3
              characters may be represented as literal characters or
              their decimal equivalent, in any combination.
   -remove  This takes 2 arguments, the two characters used to obtain a
              specific digraph.  Either the literal characters or
              decimal values may be used, as with -add.
   -clear   This takes no arguments, it just clears the internal
              digraph table.

Examples:
   To add a digraph for the character "c" by composing "a" and "b":
      /digraph -add a b c

   Another way of adding the same digraph:
      /digraph -add 61 62 63

   To remove the digraph set above:
      /digraph -remove a b

   To clear the internal digraph table:
      /digraph -clear

Other Notes:
   If your translation table is set to anything other than Latin-1,
   some (or all) characters may be converted to something your terminal
   is incapable of displaying.  Your mileage will vary.
