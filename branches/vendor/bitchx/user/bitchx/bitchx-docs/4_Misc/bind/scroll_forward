Synopsis:
   bind <key> scroll_forward

Description:
   This function allows the user to move forward in the client's lastlog
   one page at a time.  The percentage of the screen that makes up a page is
   defined by the set(4) scrollback_ratio variable.  This is useful for
   reviewing events as they happened, in a manner easier than LASTLOG
   provides.

   This function requires that SCROLL be on in order to function.  The
   SCROLL_START function must be used to use the scrollback feature, and
   SCROLL_END must be used to exit it.
