Synopsis:
   bind <key> meta4_character

Description:
   This key function is identical to the other meta functions, except that
   it is sticky.  This means that every character typed after the META4
   key will execute the META4 version of those keys.  The key is unstuck
   when the META4 key is entered again (an on/off switch of sorts).
