Synopsis:
   bind <key> forward_history

Description:
   This function replaces the contents of the current input buffer with
   the next entry in the command history.  The history buffer is circular,
   so this will often be the first command in the buffer (unless the
   BACKWARD_HISTORY function has been used recently).
