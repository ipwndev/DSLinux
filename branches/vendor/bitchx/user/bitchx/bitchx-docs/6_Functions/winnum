Synopsis:
   $winnum(<winname>)

Technical:
   This returns the window reference number of the window name specified
   by <winname>. If no arguments are passed, it defaults to the current
   window. This value will always match the value of STATUS_WINDOW in
   the window's status bar.

Practical:
   This function is mainly useful for scripts, allowing them to know at any
   given time what the current window is.

Returns:
   window number of the window specified by <winname>, or if no arguments are
   passed, the window number of the current window.

Examples:
   $winnum()               returns number of current window
