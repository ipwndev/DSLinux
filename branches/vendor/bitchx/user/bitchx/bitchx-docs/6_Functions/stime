Synopsis:
   $stime(<integer>)

Technical:
   This function is used to convert from utc time to a format that is human-
   readable.

Practical:
   This function is usually used to convert $time() output.  It isn't as
   flexible as $strftime(), but it can work with any time, not just the
   current.

Returns:
   current date/time string in human-readable form

Examples:
   $stime($time())             current time string
   $stime(0)                   the dawn of time
