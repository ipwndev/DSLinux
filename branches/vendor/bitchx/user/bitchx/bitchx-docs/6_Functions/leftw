Synopsis:
   $leftw(<count> <word list>)
   $rightw(<count> <word list>)

Technical:
   These functions are used to return a slice of the input list, from either
   the beginning or end of the list.  It returns the indicated number of
   words from the beginning or the end of the list.

Practical:
   This is mostly useful when you know you always want to get a certain
   number of starting or ending words in a list, regardless of what they
   are.  They are analogous to $left() and $right(), except they operate on
   whole words instead of characters.

Returns:
   list of words from beginning or end of word list

Examples:
   $leftw(2 hello there how are you?)         returns "hello there"
   $leftw(-1 hello there bob)                 returns nothing
   $leftw(7 hello there bob)                  returns "hello there bob"
   $rightw(2 hello there how are you?)        returns "are you?"
