Synopsis:
   $matchitem(<array> <word>)
   $rmatchitem(<array> <pattern>)

Technical:
   These functions are used to search through the given array for the item
   that best matches the given word or pattern.

Practical:
   These functions are analogous to $match() and $rmatch().  Given a word
   or pattern, they search through the given array's contents and look
   for the best match, if any.  Basically, the array's contents behave as
   if they were the list of words or patterns passed to $match() or
   $rmatch().

Returns:
   > -1   item number in array that matched
     -1   could not find specified array
     -2   could not find a matching item
