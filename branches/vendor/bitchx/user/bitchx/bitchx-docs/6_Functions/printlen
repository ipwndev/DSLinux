Synopsis:
   $printlen(<string>)

Technical:
   This function is used to determine the number of printable characters in
   <string>, as it would appear on the screen. Note that ANSI escape sequences
   are counted as printable characters, and should first be removed using the
   stripansicodes(6) function.

Practical:
   This function could be used when displaying an arbitrary string from IRC
   which could contain control-characters, such as channel names, topics,
   modes, and /whois info.

Returns:
   number of *printable* characters in <string>

Examples:
   $strlen(blahC4,2fooBbar)                  returns 10
