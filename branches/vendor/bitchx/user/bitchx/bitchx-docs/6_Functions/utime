Synopsis:
   $time()
   $utime()

Technical:
   These functions return the current time in utc format.  The only
   difference between the two is that $time() is accurate to the second,
   while $utime() is accurate to the microsecond.  Neither function takes
   any arguments.

Practical:
   Both functions return a long unsigned integer representing the number
   of seconds since 18:00, 31 December 1969, which can be parsed into a
   human-readable format by $stime().  In addition, $utime() returns an
   additional integer, representing the number of microseconds past the
   first number that the current time is.

Returns:
   utc time, plus number of microseconds past utc time for $utime()

Examples:
   $time()      might return "850381369"
   $utime()     might return "850381369 56367", which is "850381369.056367"
