Synopsis:
   $pattern(<pattern> <word list>)
   $rpattern(<word> <pattern list))

Technical:
   The $pattern() function is used to reduce a list of words to only those
   matching the given pattern.  It is paired with $rpattern(), which does
   exactly the opposite, matching a word to a list of patterns.  If no
   matches are found, an empty string is returned.

Practical:
   These functions are similar to $match() and $rmatch(), except that they
   return a list of all matches, not just an index to the best match.  This
   is useful when you know that more than one item may match, and you want
   to see all matches, not just the best.

Returns:
   list of matching words/patterns, or empty string if none match

Examples:
   $pattern(*oo* foobar blah booya)       returns "foobar booya"
   $pattern(*a* hello there bob)          returns nothing
   $rpattern(booya *oo* b* *erf)          returns "*oo* b*"
   $rpattern(booya *u* foo* *bar)         returns nothing
