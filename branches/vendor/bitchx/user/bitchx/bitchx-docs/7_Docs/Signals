Process Signals Relevant to the Operation of BitchX                       

BitchX's behavior can be controlled (to an extent) from the Unix command line
via signals.  The following signals have notable affects on the client:

   SIGSEGV   cause the client to dump core, if compiled with BITCHX_DEBUG
   SIGTERM   cause the client to immediately, but gracefully, exit
   SIGKILL   cause the client to die immediately, no cleanup
   SIGUSR1   cause the client to close all DCC connections and any EXEC'd
             processes that are still active

Typically, these signals are delivered with kill(1).  The client's process
id (PID) must be known to send it a signal.  The PID may be obtained with the
ps(1) command, or other utilities that display running processes.  The basic
form would be:

   % kill -USR1 <PID>

Refer to your system's manual pages for more information.
