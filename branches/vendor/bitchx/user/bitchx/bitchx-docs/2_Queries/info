Synopsis:
   info [<server>]

Description:
   This command doesn't serve much interactive purpose.  Rather, it shows
   some information about the creators of and contributors to irc, both
   to the ircII client and the ircd server, as well as irc in general.
   It first shows information about the client, then it queries the
   server for similar information.

   A server may be queried, though it doesn't make too much sense, since
   most servers on any given network will be running the same (or close)
   server software, so the response would be the same.
