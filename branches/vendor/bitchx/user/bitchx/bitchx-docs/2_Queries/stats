Synopsis:
   stats <type> [<server>]

Description:
   This queries the server for specific statistical information.  This
   can include a list on specific people allowed to connect to the
   server, those not allowed to connect, clients allowed to become
   operators on that server, etc.

   If a server is not specified, the current is queried.  Note that the
   STATS type is not preceded with a hyphen.

Options:
   c   C/N lines; these lines define what servers are allowed to link to
          the network via the queried server
   h   H/L lines; these define what servers may connect as hubs or leaves
   k   K lines; these define who may not connect to the server
   i   I lines; these define who is allowed to connect to the server
   l   this shows a concise breakdown of the amount of data passed between
          the server and its clients
   m   this shows how many times each protocol command has been used
   o   O lines; these define who may become an irc operator
   u   this shows the server's current uptime
   y   Y lines; these define the various client/server connection classes

Restrictions:
   Some servers disallow or restrict the use of the STATS command.  This
   is generally due to abuse of some kind.  Most often, the server will
   not allow remote queries.  This is not the case for most servers,
   though.

Other Notes:
   There are two types of O lines, global and local.  If the STATS report
   shows an O, it is global, and a o is local.  Local operators only have
   operator status and powers on their own server.

   There are two types of I lines as well, though only on networks using
   ircd2.9 code (not to be confused with Undernet's ircu2.9).  An I is a
   normal I line.  An i is a restricted line, meaning any matching client
   will be given user mode +r.  This means that the client cannot change
   its nickname or have operator status in any channel.
