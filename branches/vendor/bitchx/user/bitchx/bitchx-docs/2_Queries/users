Synopsis:
   users [<server>]

Description:
   This gives a listing of the users logged into the machine that the
   specified irc server is running on.  The output is similar to the
   Unix finger or w commands.  The users shown are not necessarily on
   irc.  If a server is not specified, the current is used.

Other Notes:
   Use of this command is deprecated.  It is almost universally disabled,
   as is serves no useful purpose related to irc, and is considered by
   some to be an invasion of privacy.
