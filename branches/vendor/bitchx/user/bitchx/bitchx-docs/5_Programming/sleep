Synopsis:
   sleep <seconds>
   pause <seconds>

Description:
   This suspends the client for the specified number of seconds.  During
   this time, the client does absolutely nothing; it quite literally goes
   to sleep.  In general, it is most useful in non-interactive automated
   scripts, and even these cases are fairly rare.

   The only external difference between SLEEP and PAUSE is that SLEEP
   blocks.  The client stops everything until it is done sleeping.  PAUSE,
   however, only pauses execution of the current code block.  This allows
   the client to stop processing an alias temporarily without locking the
   whole client up.

   There are other commands more suited to the tasks that SLEEP is
   often used for.  To wait a specified period of time before executing a
   command, use TIMER.  To wait indefinitely for a command or server query
   to complete, use WAIT.
