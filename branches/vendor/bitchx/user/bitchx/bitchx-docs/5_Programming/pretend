Synopsis:
   pretend <arguments>

Description:
   The PRETEND command allows the client to "pretend" it received the given
   arguments from the server.  It is intended only to be used inside a hook
   action.  One possible use for this might be a highly customized scripted
   DCC system.  It is mostly only of use with RAW_IRC.

Examples:
   To convert all CTCP ACTIONs to normal messages:
      on raw_irc "% PRIVMSG % :AACTION *A" {
         pretend $0-2 :(ACTION) $strip(A $4-)
      }

   fake-dcc(8); hook(5); on(5) raw_irc, send_to_server

Other Notes:
   As previously mentioned, this command is only designed to be used as
   part of a hook action.  Its behavior when not used in this manner is
   undefined.
