Synopsis:
   input      "<prompt>" <command> [<arguments>]
   input_char "<prompt>" <command> [<arguments>]

Description:
   This command is primarily for use inside scripts.  It allows the client
   to present the user with a visible prompt for specific commands.  This
   can be used for interactive commands, for command confirmation, etc.
   Multiple commands may be specified if surrounded with curly braces.

   The variant INPUT_CHAR words the same as INPUT, except it only takes a
   single character.  The primary difference is that it does not require
   that a carriage return be entered before executing the command; the first
   keystroke will trigger it.

Options:
   -noecho    stops the echoing of characters as they are typed

Examples:
   To let a command ask for confirmation:
      input "Are you REALLY sure you want to do this? (y/n) " {
         if ( [$0] == [y] ) exec rm -rf *
      }

   The basis for a simple paging mechanism:
      input_char "Press 'q' to quit, any other key to continue: " {
         unless ( [$0] == [q] ) {
            /* do whatever */
         }
      }

Aliases:
   These commands are functionally equivalent to the $"..." expando.  In
   truth, they supersedes $"...".
