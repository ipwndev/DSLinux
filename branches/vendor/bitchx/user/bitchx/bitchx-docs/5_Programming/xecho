Synopsis:
   xecho [<switch> [<arg>] [<switch> [<arg>] ...]] [--] <text>

Description:
   XECHO works just like ECHO, except that it may also accept certain
   switches to give more control over where the text is send.  Currently,
   text can be sent explicitly to the current window, to any arbitrary
   window, and can be set to only be displayed in windows with a certain
   level set.

Options:
   -banner          display the $banner in front of the text
   -current         send text to current window
   -level <level>   only echo text if target window has specified level
   -raw             send raw text to the screen, no formatting whatsoever
   -window <name>   send text to specified window (name or number)
   -nolog           do not allow the text to be logged
   -say             do not output text if called as ^xecho
   --               literal; disabled argument parsing for all text to
                    the right of the double hyphens

Examples:
   To echo text to the current window:
      xecho -c This text will appear in the current window

   To send only crap and server notices to a window called `misc'
      xecho -l snotice,crap -w misc This appears in the misc window

   To change the titlebar of an xterm:
      eval xecho -r $chr(27)]2\;Your titlebar has been changed.$chr(7)

   To output text beginning with a hyphen:
      xecho -- -= This text is treated literal =-
   outputs:
      -= This text is treated literal =-
