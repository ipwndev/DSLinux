Synopsis:
   sendline <text>

Description:
   SENDLINE sends a line of text to the client exactly as it is typed.  It
   is similar to TYPE (and thus XTYPE), except that it does not actually
   display the text on the input line as it is sent.

   The primary use of SENDLINE is inside the INPUT hook, which grabs the
   current input to the client before it is actually parsed or sent to a
   server.  SENDLINE can be used as a preprocessor of sorts.  Extreme
   caution is recommended with this practice, as an improper INPUT hook
   can effectively render the client unusable.
