Synopsis:
   call

Description:
   CALL produces a gdb/dbx-like stack trace of the alias currently being
   executed.  It returns a list of the commands currently being executed,
   tracing back from the current command, to the command that called it,
   and so forth until the CALL command itself it listed.  A deeply nested
   alias might have the following alias stack:

      [ 0] call
      [ 1] go
      [ 2] get_set
      [ 3] get_ready
      [ 4] on_your_marks
      [ 5] /superalias

   In this example, CALL was run from the "go" alias, which in turn was
   called from "get_set", which was called from "get_ready", and so on, all
   the way down to the original command executed.

   Command names appear precisely as they are typed in (which means, if
   an alias is called with a / in front of it, the slash will appear in
   the stack listing).  Additionally, in the (unlikely) event that EPIC
   were to crash, CALL is executed before the client terminates, to aid
   in debugging.

Restrictions:
   This command requires that the client be compiled with the WIND_STACK
   #define enabled; it is enabled by default.  If the client was compiled
   with it, the $info(o) string will have an 'a' in it.
