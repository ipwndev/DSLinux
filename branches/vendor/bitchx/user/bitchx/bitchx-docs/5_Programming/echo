Synopsis:
   echo [<anything>]

Description:
   This command prints its arguments back to the screen.  That's it.  It
   is useful for printing status messages from inside scripts, or inside
   hooks for redefining server messages.

   The ECHO command is also the only command (one of two, actually; see
   XECHO) that can write to the screen when DISPLAY is off. ECHO now
   has no length limitation, it can display any string within the confines
   of memory.

See Also:
   eval(5); set(4) display, input_aliases; xecho(5)

Other Notes:
   ECHO will not normally expand variables unless it is used inside an
   alias.  To force expansion, use EVAL or set INPUT_ALIASES on. This is
   not a bug, it is an intentional feature common to all commands.
