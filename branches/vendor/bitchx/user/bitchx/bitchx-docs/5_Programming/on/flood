Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]flood [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client's internal flood detection
   code is activated.  The client is "flooded" when it receives a large
   number of messages (of any sort) in a relatively short period of time.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of the flooder
   $1    type of flood detected
   $2    the channel (if any) they're flooding
   $3-   content of the flood message

Examples:
   To automatically ignore flooders:
      on ^flood "*" {
         echo *** $1 flooding detected by $0
         ignore $0 $1
      }

   To disable flood protection for network services:
      on flood ^'\\[X W NickServ ChanServ\\] *'

   set(4) flood_after, flood_rate, flood_users, flood_warning

Other Notes:
   It isn't uncommon for network problems to cause a great deal of data to
   be sent to the client at once by the server.  Suspending the client for
   awhile and then bringing it back can produce similar results.  Thus, it
   it recommended that KICK or KILL be avoided as automated responses to
   possible flooding.
