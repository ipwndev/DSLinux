Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]notice [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a NOTICE from another
   client.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of message sender
   $1-   text of message

See Also:
   notice(1); on(5) encrypted_notice, msg, send_notice

   The client does not permit any automated messages to be sent in response
   to a NOTICE.  Any attempt will result in an error.  The whole point of
   this is to prevent loops between clients.
