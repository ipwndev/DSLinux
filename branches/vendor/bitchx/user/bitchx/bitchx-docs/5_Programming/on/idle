Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]idle [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client's idle time reaches the given
   value, in minutes.  The idle time is reset when the client is given a
   command.

Parameters:
   $0    minutes idle

Examples:
   To automatically set the client away after being idle for 5 minutes:
      on ^idle "5" {
         away I'm not paying attention again...
      }

Other Notes:
   Irc servers don't have the same notion of "idle" as the client does.  To
   most servers, the client only becomes unidle by sending a message to a
   channel or a person.
