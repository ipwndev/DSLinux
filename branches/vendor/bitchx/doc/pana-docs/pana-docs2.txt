  1.  Introduction
 
  BitchX is a new and exciting IRC client being written by Colten
  Edwards <http://mailto:edwac@sk.sympatico.ca>. It includes many new
  features that IRCists have been asking for. The sources are based on
  ircii-Plutotium and ircii-EPiC to create a new and distictive IRC
  client. Heres a small list of the cool features you get with BitchX:
 
 
  o  When run under Linux, BitchX has an added bonus of being in full
     color.
 
  o  Friends, Shit, and Bot Lists built in.
 
  o  Built in Link Looking, incase your into split servers.
 
  o  Millisecond accuracy on a ping.
 
  o  Several new functions for scripters to use, and a few new
     variables.
 
  o  Extended set of DCC commands and options, like auto-getting,
     queues, public offers, and graphical displays.
 
  o  A more logical command set, like /W for /WHO and /WI for /WHOIS.
 
  o  Mass functions, like mass ban, mass op, etc.
 
  o  And tons of other commands, like /RESET and /MESG, incase your not
     very popular on IRC.
 
 
  You may be thinking great. But I get all that functionality from a
  script, or you maybe thinking BitchX is a script. Well, read on for
  more of an explanation of what BitchX is all about.
 
 
  First of all, its not a script. Secondly, when you load up a script
  say Phoenix or LiCe it takes a long time to load. Plus you probably
  have other scripts that you load. For example I used to load up to
  100k of scripts. That 100k would take up alot of memory, and was slow
  loading, and slow executing. BitchX doesn't have this problem. It has
  all these commands loaded hard-coded into the syetem, and the
  executable approximately the same size.
 
 
  The bottom line is IRC load fast, it does everything fast, in less
  memory.
 
 
  Well, if you have read up to this point, and are thinking BitchX is a
  good thing, you can get it from The BitchX Homepage
  <http://www.cs.usask.ca/undergrads/pje120/bitchx/>.
