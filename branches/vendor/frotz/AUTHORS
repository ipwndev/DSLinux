Thanks also to those who posted to rec.arts.int-fiction feedback on what I
was doing with Unix Frotz, people who checked the betas for bugs, and sent
in patches.  These include, but are not limited to:

Torbjorn Anderson, Timo Korvola, Martin Frost, Mihail Milushev, David
Picton, Chris Sullivan, Leonard Richardson, Stephen Kitt, Paul E Coad,
Paul Janzen, Brad Town, Jason C Penney, Denis Hirschfeldt, Jacob Nevins,
Matteo De Luigi, Steven Frank, Thomas Troeger, David Kinder, and others
that I've forgotten.

Michael Edmonson (author of Rezrov) and Evin Robertson (author of Nitfol)
deserve recognition for the ideas that I've borrowed from their programs.
