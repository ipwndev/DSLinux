.SH NAME
dfrotz \- interpreter for Infocom and other Z-Machine games (dumb interface)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dfrotz
.RI [ options "] " file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Frotz
is a Z-Machine interpreter.  The Z-machine is a virtual machine designed
by Infocom to run all of their text adventures.  It went through multiple
revisions during the lifetime of the company, and two further revisions
(V7 and V8) were created by Graham Nelson after the company's demise.
The specification is now quite well documented; this version of Frotz
supports version 1.0.
.P
This version of Frotz fully supports all these versions of the Z-Machine
except for version 6.  Version 6 is semi-supported by displaying the
outlines of V6 graphics with the picture number in the bottom-right
corner.

.P
This manpage is for Frotz with the dumb interface.  No sound-effect or
colors are supported.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Watch attribute setting.  Setting and clearing of attributes on objects
will be noted in debugging messages.

.TP
.B \-A
Watch attribute testing.  Every time the z-machine tests an attribute
value, the test and the result will be reported.

.TP
.B \-h N
Manually sets the screen height.  Though most curses libraries are intelligent
enough to determine the current width from the terminal, it may sometimes
be necessary to use this option to override the default.

.TP
.B \-i
Ignore fatal errors.  If a Z-Machine interpreter encounters a zcode error 
such as division-by-zero or addressing an illegal object, the proper 
response is to abort execution.  This is done because the zcode program 
doesn't have a clear idea of what is going on.  There are some games out 
there that cause fatal errors because the authors were careless and used 
an interpreter that didn't properly check for errors.  This option is 
intended to get around such bugs, but be warned that Strange Things may 
happen if fatal errors are not caught.

.TP
.B \-o
Watch object movement.  This option enables debugging messages from the
interpreter which describe the moving of objects in the object tree.

.TP
.B \-O
Watch object location.  These debugging messages detail the locations of
objects in the object tree.

.TP
.B \-p
Plain ASCII output only.  This inhibits the output of accented letters
and other characters from the Latin-1 character set, replacing them with
reasonable alternatives.  This may be necessary on devices lacking these
characters.

.TP
.B \-P
Alter the piracy opcode.  The piracy opcode was never used by Infocom.  
This switch is really only useful for those who like to toy around with
Z-code.

.TP
.B \-Q
No Quetzal.  By default, Frotz uses the new Quetzal save format when you
save your game.  If for some reason you want to save and restore using the
old Frotz format, use this flag.

.TP
.B \-R \exxx
Set runtime options.  This option may be used repeatedly.

.TP
.B \-s N
Set the random number seed value.  The given seed value is used as the initial
seed value on every restart. This is helpful for testing games like
.B Curses
which make random decisions before the first input (such that the hot
key Alt\-S does not really help).

.TP
.B \-S N
Set the transcript width.  By default your transscript files are formatted
to a width of 80 columns per line, regardless of the current screen width.
This switch allows you to change this setting. In particular, use \-S 0
to deactivate automatic line splitting in transscript files.

.TP
.B \-t
Sets the z-machine's
.I Tandy bit,
which may affect the behavior of certain Infocom games.  For example,
Zork I pretends not to have sequels, and Witness has its language
toned down.

.TP
.B \-u N
Sets the number of slots available for Frotz's multiple undo hotkey (see
below).  This defaults to twenty, which should be sufficient for most
purposes.  Setting too high a number here may be dangerous on machines
with limited memory.

.TP
.B \-w N
Manually sets the screen width.  This should not be necessary except in
special circumstances.

.TP
.B \-x
Expand the abbreviations "g", "x", and "z" to "again", "examine", and
"wait".  This switch is for use iwth old Infocom games that lack these
common abbreviations which were introduced in later games.  Use it with
caution: A few games might use "g", "x" or "z" for different purposes.

.TP
.B \-Z N
Error checking mode.  
.br
0 = don't report errors.  
.br
1 = report first instance of an error.
.br
2 = report all errors.
.br
3 = exit after any error.
.br
Default is 1 (report first instance of an error).


.SH CONFIGURATION

.SH CAVEATS
.PP
The Z Machine itself has trouble with the concept of resizing a terminal.  
It assumes that once the screen height and width are set, they will never
change; even across saves.  This made sense when 24x80 terminals were the
norm and graphical user interfaces were mostly unknown.  I'm fairly sure
there's a way around this problem, but for now, don't resize an xterm in
which frotz is running.  Also, you should try to make sure the terminal
on which you restore a saved game has the same dimensions as the one on
which you saved the game.
