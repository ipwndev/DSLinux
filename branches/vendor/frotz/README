FROTZ V2.43 - An interpreter for all Infocom and other Z-machine games.
Complies with standard 1.0 of Graham Nelson's specification.

Originally written by Stefan Jokisch in 1995-1997.
Ported to Unix by Galen Hazelwood.
Reference code and Unix port currently maintained by David Griffith.

- Compiles and runs on most common flavors of Unix, both open source and not.
- Plays all Z-code games including V6.
- Old-style sound support through OSS driver.
- Config files.
- Configurable error checking.
- Default use of the Quetzal file format.  Command line option to use the
  old format.  There are several differences between the old-style save 
  format at Quetzal such that converting from old-style and Quetzal is 
  difficult if not impossible.  This also means you can't restore an 
  old-style save and then save your game in Quetzal.
- Optional speech synthesis and recognition through FLITE and Sphinx.
- Distributed under the GNU Public License.
