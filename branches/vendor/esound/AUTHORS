Program History:

    EsounD was coded and maintained by Eric B. Mitchell (aka 'Ricdude) <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>
    before moving on to other things.

    This was based on a prototype sound daemon created by Carsten 
    Haitzler (aka The Rasterman).  Some snips of his code are 
    probably still lurking about, but the overwhelming majority 
    of it was written from scratch.

Additional Credits:

    Chutt <#E>, for insanely agreeing to alpha test, and porting 
    Emusic, to EsounD.  Emusic is a highly customizable sound player
    available from:  http://www.icom.net/~smelecat/emp3/index.htm.
    And for the initial configure setup

    carrying on, during my untimely extended leaves of absence.

    The masses of "early adopters" who beat the snot out of esound
    early on.
