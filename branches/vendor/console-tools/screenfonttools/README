Several corrections in kbd-0.90 are due to shields@tembel.org
(Michael Shields).

jrs@world.std.com (Rick Sladkey) suggested some improvements
to the Makefile.

resize has been renamed resizecons in order to avoid name conflicts.

disalloc has been renamed deallocvt since people tell me
that `disallocate' is bad English; also it is good to have
the `vt' in the name, just like in chvt.
Now open should be renamed openvt...

A few Unicode related things are not installed by default, since
not many people use them. Install them yourself, if you need them.
