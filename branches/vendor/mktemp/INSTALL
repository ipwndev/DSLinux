Installation instructions for mktemp
====================================

Mktemp uses a `configure' script to probe the capabilities and type
of the system in question.  Please read this document fully before
configuring and building mktemp.  You may also wish to read the file
INSTALL.configure which explains more about the `configure' script.

Simple mktemp installation
==========================

For most systems and configurations it is possible simply to:

    1)  If you previously ran `configure' on a different host
        you will probably want to do a `make distclean' to remove
        the old `config.cache' file.  Otherwise, `configure'
        will complain and refuse to run.  Alternately, you can
        simply `rm config.cache'.

    2)  You should probably read the `Available configure options' section
	to see if there are any special options you may want or need.

    2a) If you wish to build mktemp in the source directory, `cd' there
	and type `./configure'.

    2b) If you wish to build mktemp in another directory and the make
	program you are using supports the `VPATH' variable (GNU make
	and most modern make programs do), `cd' the directory where you
	wish to bulid mktemp and type `/path/to/source/configure'.

    3)  Type `make' to compile mktemp.

    4)  Type `make install' (as root) to install mktemp and its manual
        page.  You can also install various pieces the package via
        the install-binaries and install-man make targets.

Available configure options
===========================

This section describes flags accepted by the mktemp's `configure' script.
Defaults are listed in brackets after the description.

Configuration:
  --cache-file=FILE
	Cache test results in FILE

  --help
	Print the usage/help info

  --no-create
	Do not create output files

  --quiet, --silent
	Do not print `checking...' messages

Directory and file names:
  --prefix=PREFIX
	Install architecture-independent files in PREFIX.  [/usr/local]

  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX
	Install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX. [same as prefix]

  --bindir=DIR
	Where the mktemp executable will be installed.  [EPREFIX/bin]

  --mandir=DIR
	Install man page in DIR [PREFIX/man]

  --srcdir=DIR
	Find the sources in DIR [configure dir or ..]

Special features/options:
  --with-CC=path
	Specifies path to C compiler you wish to use.

  --with-incpath
	Adds the specified directories to CPPFLAGS so configure and the
	compiler will look there for include files.  Multiple directories
	may be specified as long as they are space separated.
	Eg: --with-incpath="/usr/local/include /opt/include"

  --with-libpath
        Adds the specified directories to LDFLAGS so configure and
        the compiler will look there for libraries.  Multiple
        directories may be specified as with --with-incpath.

  --with-libraries
        Adds the specified libaries to LIBS so mktemp will link
        against them.  If the library doesn't start with `-l' or
        end in `.a' or `.o' a `-l' will be prepended to it.  Multiple
        libraries may be specified as long as they are space
        separated.

  --with-man
	When installing the manual page, install the one in man(7) format.

  --with-mdoc
	When installing the manual page, install the one in mdoc(7) format.

  --with-random=path
	Mktemp with use `path' as the path to a device from which to read
	random data.  This defaults to /dev/urandom if it exists.

  --with-libc
	Causes mktemp to use the mkstemp(3) and mkdtemp(3) (if it exists)
	in the system C library instead of mktemp's own private version.
	You should only enable this option if you know that the version
	of mkstemp(3) your OS ships with is a good one.
	NOTE: if your OS doesn't have a mkdtemp(3) function, a rather
	      simplistic implementation with be used.
