replimenu change log

0.9: Flicker-fix and new feature
        * On close consoles (e.g. VESA framebuffer) the menu would flicker
          whenever moving up/down the menu. This has now been fixed (with a
          dirty hack, hell, entire replimenu is getting one big dirty hack).

        * Inputboxes, msgboxes and yesnoboxes can now have a multi-line message
          (icaption) in them. Separate the string in "icaption" with "\n" (see
          example.menu) to break lines. Unfortunately, lines don't wrap (yet).

0.8.1: Multiline string constants removed
	* Removed multiline string constants to support GCC 3.3.

0.8: BUG FIXES
	* Imported replimenu into SENTINIX CVS.
        * `labels' that are too long for screen are now simply truncated.
	* Fixed an infinite loop bug.
        * Added checks before giving an unsigned int a signed value (a bug that
          created some weird output if screen was too small).
        * My xterm crashes if window width is 2 or less when running replimenu.
          It's probably not a replimenu bug, but rather a bug in xterm.

0.7: GENERAL FIXES
        * Reproduced some features found in a patch for replimenu 0.3
          contributed by Paul Whittaker, made for his DIET-PC project
          (http://diet-pc.sf.net).
        * Spacebar has the same effect as return on checkboxes and
          radiobuttons.
        * Yet a new type: defaultfromenv. The `defaultfromenv' type initializes
          an item's `default' variable (if `default' is empty in the menufile)
          by taking the value from the RM_name environment variable (name is
          the value of the `name' variable).
        * Fixed help `-h' TTY problem: The isatty() check is now after the
          getopt() stuff, it's now possible to run "replimenu -h | less".

0.6: NEW FEATURES
        * Five new types: hidden, password, chain, auto and msgbox.
        * One new variable: exitafterauto.
        * New command line options: -g, -a and -e.
        * `notempty' characteristics changed.
        * One bug that caused segfaults has been found and resolved.

0.5: Caption for input boxes and PREFIX installation support.
        * Added support for an alternative caption for input boxes and yesno
          types using the new `icaption' menu structure member.
        * You may now type "make PREFIX=/usr_or_whatever install" to easily
          install replimenu somewhere else than under /usr/local.

0.4: `dummy' items both first and last.
	* You may now use `dummy' items (`br') both first and last, something
	  which was previously un-supported.

0.3: QUIT commands, exit code proxy, getopt, cosmetics and new variable.
	* Made the Makefile target `dist' available.
	* Added a question mark after the text on `ask' type dialog boxes.
	* Added the global variable `nocls' to be able to prevent replimenu
	  from clearing the screen when exiting.
	* Made it possible to execute a command in a `QUIT' menu item.
	* Added proxy of exit codes from the `runonexit' command and any menu
	  items named `QUIT'. replimenu will now exit with the command's exit
	  code.
	* Added the `runonexitfirst', `runonexitlast', `usecommandretval' and
	  `nocls' structure types for use with `QUIT' menu items.
	* Replaced the old option parser with getopt, which increased size. :(
	* One "cosmetic" change in the `dummy'-type.
	* Added the "br" single-line variable which is an alias for a `dummy'
	  menu item structure.

0.2: MORE FEATURES AND BUG FIXES.
	* Added a "radiobutton" menu item type.
	* Added a "checkbox" menu item type.
	* Changed the characteristics of the "dummy" type.
	* Various bug fixes.

0.1: INITIAL RELEASE.
