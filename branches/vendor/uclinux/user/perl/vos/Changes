This file documents the changes made to port Perl to the Stratus
VOS operating system.

For 5.6.1:
     Updated "build.cm" to build perl using either the alpha or GA
          version of POSIX.
     Updated "Changes".
     Updated "compile_perl.cm" to use either the alpha or GA
          version of POSIX.
     Split "config.def" into config.alpha.def and config.ga.def;
          one for each version. Use the configure_perl.cm macro
          to select the appropriate version.
     Split "config.h" into config.alpha.h and config.ga.h. Use the
          configure_perl.cm macro to select the appropriate version.
     Updated "config.pl". It now diagnoses undefined (missing) and
          unused substitution variables. When a new version of
          Perl comes out, run "configure_perl.cm", add any missing
          definitions to config.*.def, and remove any unused
          definitions.
     Removed "config_h.SH_orig". It is no longer needed.
     Added "configure_perl.cm". It is used to configure perl so that
          it can be built with either version of VOS POSIX.1 support.
     Added "install_perl.cm" to install Perl into the appropriate
          system directories.
     Updated "perl.bind" to work with either the alpha or GA
          version of POSIX.
     Updated "vosish.h" to just use the standard "unixish.h" since
          there are no changes needed at this time.

After 5.005_63:
     Supplied "config.pl" perl script that takes "config_h.SH_orig"
          and "config.def" as input and produces "config.h.new".
          With some luck, you will just need to edit "config.def"
          to create a new port.
     Updated "build.cm".
     Updated "compile_perl.cm".
     Added   "config.def".
     Updated "config.h".
     Added   "config.pl".
     Updated "config_h.SH_orig".
     Updated "perl.bind".
     Updated "README.vos".
     Updated "vos_dummies.c".
     Updated "vosish.h".

after 5.005_02:
     Initial release.
     Supplied "build.cm" command macro to build perl.
     Supplied "Changes" to document the change history.
     Supplied "compile_perl.cm" to launch processes to compile all
          four versions of the Perl 5 binaries.
     Supplied "config.h" to configure Perl 5 to VOS. Unfortunately,
          since VOS does not have the configure tool, this file was
          built by hand by editing "config_h.SH".
     Supplied "config_h.SH_orig", which is the version of this file
          that was current for version 5.005_02. Use this to discover
          any subsequent changes to config_h.SH that must be
          hand-copied into the real config.h.
     Supplied "perl.bind" to control the VOS binder.
     Supplied "README.vos" to describe the VOS port.
     Supplied "test_vos_dummies.c" to test the VOS dummy functions.
     Supplied "vos_dummies.c" to trap unimplemented POSIX functions.
     Supplied "vosish.h" to configure Perl 5 to VOS.
