Cross site scripting, buffer overflow and remote command
execution on QuickTime/Darwin Streaming Administration
Server.

This is due to parsing problems with per script:
parse_xml.cgi.

The worst of these vulnerabilities allows for remote
command execution usually as root or administrator.

These servers are installed by default on port 1220.

See:
http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a022403-1.txt

Solution:  Obtain a patch or new software from Apple or
block this port (TCP 1220) from internet access.

*** Nessus reports this vulnerability using only
*** information that was gathered. Only the existance
*** of the potentially vulnerable cgi script was tested.
