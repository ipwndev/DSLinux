 * output.c -- Handles the Nmap output system.  This currently         *
 * involves console-style human readable output, XML output,           *
 * Script |<iddi3 output, and the legacy greppable output (used to be  *
 * called "machine readable").  I expect that future output forms      *
 * (such as HTML) may be created by a different program, library, or   *
 * script using the XML output.                                        *
 *                                                                     *

 *  Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix     *

 *  your changes to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation     *

 *  the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems    *
 *  for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  Nmap     *
 *  will always be available Open Source.  If you wish to specify      *
