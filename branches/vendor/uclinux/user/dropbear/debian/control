Description: lightweight SSH2 server
 dropbear is a SSH 2 server designed to be small enough to be used in small
 memory environments, while still being functional and secure enough for
 general use.
 .
 It implements most required features of the SSH 2 protocol, and other
 features such as X11 and authentication agent forwarding.
