.TP 
\fB\-l FILE, \-\-log=FILE\fR

Install new database in DIRECTORY. The directory must be writeable for the 'clamav' user or unprivileged user running freshclam.
.TP 
\fB\-u USER, \-\-user USER\fR
Run as USER. By default (when started by root) freshclam drops privileges and works as the 'clamav' user.
