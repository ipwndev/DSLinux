PSTI/Traconex 1020 WWV/WWVH Receiver</H3>

<HR>
<H4>
Synopsis</H4>
Address: 127.127.3.<I>u</I>
<BR>Reference ID: <TT>WWV</TT>
<BR>Driver ID: <TT>WWV_PST</TT>
<BR>Serial Port: <TT>/dev/wwv<I>u</I></TT>; 9600 baud, 8-bits, no parity
<BR>Features: <TT>tty_clk</TT>
<H4>
Description</H4>
This driver supports the PSTI 1010 and Traconex 1020 WWV/WWVH Receivers.
No specific claim of accuracy is made for these receiver, but actual experience
suggests that 10 ms would be a conservative assumption.

<P>The DIP-switches should be set for 9600 bps line speed, 24-hour day-of-year
format and UTC time zone. Automatic correction for DST should be disabled.
It is very important that the year be set correctly in the DIP-switches;
otherwise, the day of year will be incorrect after 28 April of a normal
or leap year. The propagation delay DIP-switches should be set according
to the distance from the transmitter for both WWV and WWVH, as described
in the instructions. While the delay can be set only to within 11 ms, the
fudge time1 parameter can be used for vernier corrections.

<P>Using the poll sequence <TT>QTQDQM</TT>, the response timecode is in
three sections totalling 50 ASCII printing characters, as concatenated
by the driver, in the following format:
<PRE>ahh:mm:ss.fffs&lt;cr> yy/dd/mm/ddd&lt;cr>
frdzycchhSSFTttttuuxx&lt;cr>

on-time = first &lt;cr>
hh:mm:ss.fff = hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
a = AM/PM indicator (' ' for 24-hour mode)
yy = year (from DIPswitches)
dd/mm/ddd = day of month, month, day of year
s = daylight-saving indicator (' ' for 24-hour mode)
f = frequency enable (O = all frequencies enabled)
r = baud rate (3 = 1200, 6 = 9600)
d = features indicator (@ = month/day display enabled)
z = time zone (0 = UTC)
y = year (5 = 91)
cc = WWV propagation delay (52 = 22 ms)
hh = WWVH propagation delay (81 = 33 ms)
SS = status (80 or 82 = operating correctly)
F = current receive frequency (4 = 15 MHz)
T = transmitter (C = WWV, H = WWVH)
tttt = time since last update (0000 = minutes)
uu = flush character (03 = ^c)
xx = 94 (unknown)</PRE>
The alarm condition is indicated by other than <TT>8</TT> at <TT>a</TT>,
which occurs during initial synchronization and when received signal is
lost for an extended period; unlock condition is indicated by other than
<TT>0000</TT> in the <TT>tttt</TT> subfield.
<H4>
Monitor Data</H4>
When enabled by the <TT>flag4</TT> fudge flag, every received timecode
is written as-is to the <TT>clockstats</TT> file.
