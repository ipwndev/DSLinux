		      WGET-RELATED MAILING LISTS

Wget has several mailing lists, all hosted by SunSITE.dk.

wget@sunsite.dk:

    The mailing list for users and developers.  This is the preferred
    place to post bug reports and suggestions, as well as discuss
    development-related matters.

    To post to the list, send mail to <wget@sunsite.dk>.  To
    subscribe, send mail to <wget-subscribe@sunsite.dk>.

    NOTE: The list allows posts from non-subscribers.  This is
    intentional; I hate having to subscribe to a list if I only want
    to ask a single question.  If you're not subscribed to the list
    and ask something, don't forget to request that the responses be
    Cc'ed to you.

    This mailing list is archived at:

	http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/

wget-patches@sunsite.dk:

    The mailing list for patch submission.  Please see the PATCHES
    file for a detailed description of how to send patches to this
    list.

    This is list is also open to non-subscribers, but it is *not* a
    discussion list.  It only ever distribute patches and immediate
    responses to a patch.  If you wish to take very active part in
    development, you might wish to subscribe to it anyway, and receive
    the new patches.  To do that, send mail to
    <wget-patches-subscribe@sunsite.dk>.

wget-cvs@sunsite.dk:

    This list just distributes notices about commits to the Wget CVS
    tree.  It has no discussions, and it is not interesting unless you
    wish to take part in development.  If so, send mail to
    <wget-cvs-subscribe@sunsite.dk> to subscribe.

As of this writing, the mail alias <bug-wget@gnu.org> is an alias for
<wget@sunsite.dk>.
