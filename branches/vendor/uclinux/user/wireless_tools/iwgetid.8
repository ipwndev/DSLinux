.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iwgetid
is used to find out the NWID, ESSID or AP/Cell Address of the wireless
network that is currently used. The information reported is the same
as the one shown by
.BR iwconfig ", but " iwgetid
is easier to integrate in various scripts.
.br
By default,
.B iwgetid
will print the
.I ESSID
of the device, and if the device doesn't have any ESSID it will print
its
.IR NWID .
.\"
.\" OPTIONS part
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --scheme
This option disables pretty-printing of the information, only the raw
ESSID (or NWID, or AP Address) is printed. Also, characters that are
not alphanumerics (like space, punctuation and control characters) are
skipped.
.br
The resulting output is a valid Pcmcia scheme identifier (that may be
used as an argument of the command
.BR "cardctl scheme" ).
This format is also ideal when using the result of iwgetid as a
variable in
.I Shell
or
.I Perl
scripts.
.TP
.B --ap
Display the MAC address of the Wireless
.I Access Point
or the
.IR Cell .
.TP
.B --freq
Display the current
.I frequency
or
.I channel
used by the interface.
.TP
.B --mode
Display the current
.I mode
of the interface.
.TP
.B --protocol
Display the
.I protocol name
of the interface. This allow to identify all the cards that are
compatible with each other and accept the same type of
configuration.
.br
This can also be used to
.I check Wireless Extension support
on the interface, as this is the only attribute that all drivers
supporting Wireless Extension are mandated to support.
