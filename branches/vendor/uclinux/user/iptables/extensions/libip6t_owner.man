This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet
creator, for locally-generated packets.  It is only valid in the
.B OUTPUT
chain, and even this some packets (such as ICMP ping responses) may
have no owner, and hence never match.  This is regarded as experimental.
.TP

.TP
.BI "--pid-owner " "processid"
