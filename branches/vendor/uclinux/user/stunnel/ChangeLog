Version 3.8p4, 2000.06.25  bri@stunnel.org:
* fixes for Windows platform

Version 3.8p3, 2000.06.24  bri@stunnel.org:
* Compile time definitions for the following:
	--with-cert-dir
	--with-cert-file
	--with-pem-dir
	--enable-ssllib-cs
* use daemon() function instead of daemonize, if available
* fixed FreeBSD threads checking (patch from robertw@wojo.com)
* added -S flag, allowing you to choose which default verify
  sources to use
* relocated service name output logging until after log_open.
  (no longer outputs log info to inetd socket, causing bad SSL)
* -V flag now outputs the default values used by stunnel
* Removed DH param generation in Makefile.in
* Moved stunnel.pem to sample.pem to keep people from blindly using it
* Removed confusing stunnel.pem check from Makefile.

* UPGRADE NOTE: this version seriously changes several previous stunnel
  default behaviours.  There are no longer any default cert file/dirs
  compilied into stunnel, you must use the --with-cert-dir and
  --with-cert-file configure arguments to set these manually, if desired.
  Stunnel does not use the underlying ssl library defaults by default
  unless configured with --enable-ssllib-cs.  Note that these can always
  be enabled at run time with the -A,-a, and -S flags.
  Additionally, unless --with-pem-dir is specified at compile time,
  stunnel will default to looking for stunnel.pem in the current directory.

Version 3.8p2, 2000.06.13  bri@stunnel.org:

* Checking for threads in c_r library for FreeBSD.
* Some compatibility fixes for Ultrix.
* configure.in has been cleaned up.
  Separate directories for SSL certs and SSL libraries/headers
  are no longer supported.  SSL ports maintainers should create
  softlinks in the main openssl directory if necessary.
* Added --with-ssl option to specify SSL directory.
* Added setgid (-g) option.
  (Special thanks to Brian Hatch for his feedback and support)
* Added pty.c based on a Public Domain code by Tatu Ylonen
* Distribution files are now signed with GnuPG

Version 3.7, 2000.02.10:
* /usr/pkg added to list of possible SSL directories for pkgsrc installs
  of OpenSSL under NetBSD.
* Added the -s option, which setuid()s to the specified user when running
  in daemon mode. Useful for cyrus imapd.
  (both based on patch by George Coulouris)
* PTY code ported to Solaris.  The port needs some more testing.
* Added handler for SIGINT.
* Added --with-random option to ./configure script.
* Fixed some problems with autoconfiguration on Solaris and others.
