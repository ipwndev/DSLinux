This directory contains patches for adding Host AP driver to various
versions of pcmcia-cs. The patch file contains only minimal changes to
the existing distribution files. It should thus be easy to update for
new versions. In addition, source code for the Host AP driver, i.e.,
driver/modules/hostap*.[ch] (excluding hostap_{plx,pci}.c), needs to
be copied to pcmcia-cs's directory wireless.

Example commands for patching a pcmcia-cs release:

cd pcmcia-cs-3.1.34
patch -p1 < ../hostap/pcmcia-cs-patches/hostap-pcmcia-cs-3.1.34.patch
cp ../hostap/driver/modules/hostap*.[ch] wireless
rm wireless/hostap_{plx,pci}.c
