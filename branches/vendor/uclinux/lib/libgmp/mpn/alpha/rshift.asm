dnl  This code runs at 4.8 cycles/limb on the 21064.  With infinite unrolling,
dnl  it would take 4 cycles/limb.  It should be possible to get down to 3
dnl  cycles/limb since both ldq and stq can be paired with the other used
dnl  instructions.  But there are many restrictions in the 21064 pipeline that
dnl  makes it hard, if not impossible, to get down to 3 cycles/limb:

dnl  1. ldq has a 3 cycle delay, srl and sll have a 2 cycle delay.
dnl  2. Only aligned instruction pairs can be paired.
dnl  3. The store buffer or silo might not be able to deal with the bandwidth.
