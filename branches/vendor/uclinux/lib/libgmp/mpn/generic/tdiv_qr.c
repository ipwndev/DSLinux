/* mpn_tdiv_qr -- Divide the numerator (np,nn) by the denominator (dp,dn) and
   write the nn-dn+1 quotient limbs at qp and the dn remainder limbs at rp.  If
   qxn is non-zero, generate that many fraction limbs and append them after the
   other quotient limbs, and update the remainder accordningly.  The input
   operands are unaffected.

   Preconditions:
   1. The most significant limb of of the divisor must be non-zero.
   2. No argument overlap is permitted.  (??? relax this ???)
   3. nn >= dn, even if qxn is non-zero.  (??? relax this ???)

   The time complexity of this is O(qn*qn+M(dn,qn)), where M(m,n) is the time
   complexity of multiplication.

   THIS IS AN INTERNAL FUNCTION WITH A MUTABLE INTERFACE.  IT IS ONLY
   SAFE TO CALL THIS FUNCTION THROUGH DOCUMENTED INTERFACES.  IN FACT,
   IT IS ALMOST GUARANTEED THAT THIS FUNCTION WILL CHANGE INCOMPATIBLY
   OR DISAPPEAR IN A FUTURE GNU MP RELEASE.

   (We're considering to:
     1. Make it return the most significant quotient limb instead of store it
     2. Change the name to mpn_tdiv_qr_mn.)

	       Divide a numerator N with nn limbs by a denominator D with dn
	       limbs forming a quotient of nn-dn+1 limbs.  When qn is small
	       compared to dn, conventional division algorithms perform poorly.
	       We want an algorithm that has an expected running time that is
	       dependent only on qn.  It is assumed that the most significant
	       limb of the numerator is smaller than the most significant limb
	       of the denominator.

	       Algorithm (very informally stated):

	       1) Divide the 2 x qn most significant limbs from the numerator
		  by the qn most significant limbs from the denominator.  Call
		  the result qest.  This is either the correct quotient, but
		  might be 1 or 2 too large.  Compute the remainder from the
		  division.  (This step is implemented by a mpn_divrem call.)

	       2) Is the most significant limb from the remainder < p, where p
		  is the product of the most significant limb from the quotient
		  and the next(d).  (Next(d) denotes the next ignored limb from
		  the denominator.)  If it is, decrement qest, and adjust the
		  remainder accordingly.

	       3) Is the remainder >= qest?  If it is, qest is the desired
		  quotient.  The algorithm terminates.

	       4) Subtract qest x next(d) from the remainder.  If there is
		  borrow out, decrement qest, and adjust the remainder
		  accordingly.

	       5) Skip one word from the denominator (i.e., let next(d) denote
		  the next less significant limb.  */
