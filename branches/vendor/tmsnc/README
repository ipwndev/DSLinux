TMSNC - Textbased MSN Client v0.3.2

Install by running:

	./configure
	make

and then as root you run

	make install

and TMSNC is installed in /usr/local/bin unless you specified another path.

Note: If you are upgrading from an earlier version you may want to delete your tmsnc.conf file.

If it refuses to compile, make sure you've installed ncurses-dev and libssl-dev. If it 
still doesn't want to work, e-mail me (sanoix@gmail.com).

 * Log in/out
 * Retrieve list of users
