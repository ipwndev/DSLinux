# The bug occurs when extracting from a tarfile a directory when the directory
# already exists and the version in the tarfile has more permissive
# permissions than your umask.  In this case, the permissions of the
# existing directory will toggle between the version which complies with
# your umask (which would be correct, without -p) and the version from the
# tarfile.
