               --------------------------------------------------

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.0:

Corrected color and html mode routines.

get_expr() now has equation space pull.
You may now enter a "#" followed by an equation space number when prompted for an expression.

Ported nintegrate command to non-equations.  No more commands to port.

"make install" works better and installs the "tests" directory.

Made redirected output ignore screen_columns.

Added "-q" option (quiet mode, don't display prompts).

The Mathomatic man page was improved.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.1:

Fixed sum and product command docs and code.

Split off "am.c" into "solve.c" and "am.c".

Added "tests/trig.in".  (trig functions!)

The list command now displays the equation numbers,
but not when exporting or saving.

Added "tests/hypertrig.in".

Allow limit command to work with non-equations.

An optional step parameter was added to the sum and product commands.

Minor documentation updates.

Corrected makefiles to install everything in /usr/local.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.2:

Ported matho-primes, matho-twin, and matho-pascal to long doubles.
"make test" added in "primes" directory.

Alphabetic case sensitive mode set by default.

Added "list maxima" option.  "list export" is now for other programs.

Code cleanup.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.3:

Removed parsing of "infinity" and fixed parsing of "inf".

Removed matho-around.  Use GNU "seq | factor" instead.

Allow "#+"number and "#-"number at main prompt, to select relative equation numbers.

Removed all primes (') support from variable names.
This is for compatibility with other math programs.

Added version command.

Added "-v" option.

Split off super.c into super.c and poly.c.
All polynomial routines are now in poly.c.

Improved roots command and put it in tests.

Fixed bug simplifying "a = (e# + (e#*i#))^(pi + (pi*i#))".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.4:

Added "doc/manpage.html", which is the man page for Mathomatic
generated with "groff -Thtml -man".

Made sure all HTML files have the extension ".html".

Made sure we can allocate at least 1 equation space on startup.

Made entering things like "#1 a" succeed at entering a single variable expression.
Previously it gave an error.

Fix-ups to the symbolic math library.

Increased power of limit command.
A limit expression with infinity in it is assumed to be infinity.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.5:

Fixed compatibility problem with "list export" and "list maxima".
Constants are now parenthesized when exporting.

Added "tests/conversions.in".

Made "code integer" command work with more languages than C and Java.

Added "code python" command option.

Added "fact/fact.c" and "fact/fact.py", which are factorial functions.

Completed "help geometry" page.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.6:

Code cleanup and commenting.  Minor reduction in code size.

Changed all occurrences of "mathomatic.com" to "mathomatic.org".

Minor updates to the Mathomatic Command Reference.

Added some useful warnings to the gcc compile and caught and fixed some errors.

Split off "factor.c" into "factor_int.c" and "factor.c".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.7:

Doubled the default max expression size.  Display current size on startup.

Made solve_sub() return -1 for an identity.

Speedup of the simplify command.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.8:

A number of minor fixups.

Code cleanup.  Code size reduced.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.9:

Bug fix for nintegrate command.  Result was correct but not fully reduced.

Added "twin" option to "primes/matho-primes", removed "primes/matho-twin".

Automatically determine the variable if none is specified
with the derivative and taylor commands.

Increased the maximum variable length to 1000 characters.

Cleaned up "main.c".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.10:

"matho-primes pal" wasn't working, fixed.

Improved the "Equation not defined" error message for new users.

Worked on matho-primes program.

Automatically determine the variable if none is specified
with the extrema command.

Code cleanup.

Helped simplification of complex exponentials.

Parse things like "2 2" as "2*2", instead of giving a syntax error.
The default operator is always times.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.11:

A bunch of very minor changes and improvements.

Code cleanup.

Documentation improvements.

Updated command description text in help command.

Converted many functions to inline that are only used once and should be inline.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.12:

Improved matho-primes by making primes buffer variable size.

Added "set factor_integers" option.

Removed "simplify poly" option, it was rarely useful.

Code cleanup, commenting, and speed optimization.

Improved simplification, added the fixed problem ("tests/linear.in") to the tests.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.13:

A number of minor changes.

Fixes and improvements to the Mathomatic Command Reference.

Upgraded clear and set commands to accept more than one argument.

Gave real and imaginary commands a useful argument.

Fixed a sloppiness in command line parsing in function get_range().

Code cleanup.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.14:

Excess variables cleanup of taylor command.

Changed argument of push command from an equation number to an equation number range.

Added easy selection of equation spaces, just type the number at the prompt.

Allow flist command when Mathomatic is compiled as a library.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.5.15:

Allow curly brackets ("{}") as parentheses.

Allow all taylor command input on the command line.
Add taylor command to tests.

Added -u option (Unbuffered mode).  Previously output was always unbuffered.
