; This is a general equation for an ellipse that was
; created using the rule that the sum of the distances (k)
; from any point on the perimeter (x, y) to the two foci,
; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is a constant.

k = ((((x1-x)^2)+((y1-y)^2))^0.5)+((((x2-x)^2)+((y2-y)^2))^0.5)

; The equation for an ellipse centered at the origin:

1=x^2/radius1^2+y^2/radius2^2
