The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
removed in the kernel source tree.  Every entry should contain what
exactly is going away, why it is happening, and who is going to be doing
the work.  When the feature is removed from the kernel, it should also
be removed from this file.

---------------------------

What:	devfs
When:	July 2005
Files:	fs/devfs/*, include/linux/devfs_fs*.h and assorted devfs
	function calls throughout the kernel tree
Why:	It has been unmaintained for a number of years, has unfixable
	races, contains a naming policy within the kernel that is
	against the LSB, and can be replaced by using udev.
Who:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>

---------------------------

What:	RAW driver (CONFIG_RAW_DRIVER)
When:	December 2005
Why:	declared obsolete since kernel 2.6.3
	O_DIRECT can be used instead
Who:	Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de>

---------------------------

What:	RCU API moves to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
When:	April 2006
Files:	include/linux/rcupdate.h, kernel/rcupdate.c
Why:	Outside of Linux, the only implementations of anything even
	vaguely resembling RCU that I am aware of are in DYNIX/ptx,
	VM/XA, Tornado, and K42.  I do not expect anyone to port binary
	drivers or kernel modules from any of these, since the first two
	are owned by IBM and the last two are open-source research OSes.
	So these will move to GPL after a grace period to allow
	people, who might be using implementations that I am not aware
	of, to adjust to this upcoming change.
Who:	Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@us.ibm.com>

---------------------------

What:	IEEE1394 Audio and Music Data Transmission Protocol driver,
	Connection Management Procedures driver
When:	November 2005
Files:	drivers/ieee1394/{amdtp,cmp}*
Why:	These are incomplete, have never worked, and are better implemented
	in userland via raw1394 (see http://freebob.sourceforge.net/ for
	example.)
Who:	Jody McIntyre <scjody@steamballoon.com>

---------------------------

What:	raw1394: requests of type RAW1394_REQ_ISO_SEND, RAW1394_REQ_ISO_LISTEN
When:	November 2005
Why:	Deprecated in favour of the new ioctl-based rawiso interface, which is
	more efficient.  You should really be using libraw1394 for raw1394
	access anyway.
Who:	Jody McIntyre <scjody@steamballoon.com>

---------------------------

What:	i2c sysfs name change: in1_ref, vid deprecated in favour of cpu0_vid
When:	November 2005
Files:	drivers/i2c/chips/adm1025.c, drivers/i2c/chips/adm1026.c
Why:	Match the other drivers' name for the same function, duplicate names
	will be available until removal of old names.
Who:	Grant Coady <gcoady@gmail.com>

---------------------------

What:	PCMCIA control ioctl (needed for pcmcia-cs [cardmgr, cardctl])
When:	November 2005
Files:	drivers/pcmcia/: pcmcia_ioctl.c
Why:	With the 16-bit PCMCIA subsystem now behaving (almost) like a
	normal hotpluggable bus, and with it using the default kernel
	infrastructure (hotplug, driver core, sysfs) keeping the PCMCIA
	control ioctl needed by cardmgr and cardctl from pcmcia-cs is
	unnecessary, and makes further cleanups and integration of the
	PCMCIA subsystem into the Linux kernel device driver model more
	difficult. The features provided by cardmgr and cardctl are either
	handled by the kernel itself now or are available in the new
	pcmciautils package available at
	http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/
Who:	Dominik Brodowski <linux@brodo.de>

---------------------------

What:	ip_queue and ip6_queue (old ipv4-only and ipv6-only netfilter queue)
When:	December 2005
Why:	This interface has been obsoleted by the new layer3-independent
	"nfnetlink_queue".  The Kernel interface is compatible, so the old
	ip[6]tables "QUEUE" targets still work and will transparently handle
	all packets into nfnetlink queue number 0.  Userspace users will have
	to link against API-compatible library on top of libnfnetlink_queue 
	instead of the current 'libipq'.
Who:	Harald Welte <laforge@netfilter.org>
