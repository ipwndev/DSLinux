WATCH %|[[+|-]<nick>][ [+|-]<nick> ...]

Works only in networks using Bahamut ircd.

WATCH is somewhat equal to ISON/NOTIFY, but server-based. With WATCH server sends status information to client, instead of client sending ISON's. Therefore WATCH is technically a bit smarter solution than ISON/NOTIFY. The only disadvantage is your WATCH list not being "saved". Once you disconnect, your WATCH list will get cleared.

WATCH is based on a nick, and must be prepended with a plus ('+') to be added to your watch list. A minus sign ('-') will remove an entry from the list. With no arguments, WATCH returns a list of your WATCH list entries.
