SET %|[-clear | -default] [<key> [<value>]]

You can view or change the settings with /SET command.

/SET without any arguments displays all the settings. /SET <key> displays settings whose key (partly) matches <key> /SET <key> <value> sets <key> to <value>

Boolean settings accept only values ON, OFF and TOGGLE. You can also use /TOGGLE command to change them, so /TOGGLE <key> behaves like /SET <key> TOGGLE. /TOGGLE also accepts arguments ON and OFF when /TOGGLE behaves exactly like /SET.

Remember that changes are not saved until you use /SAVE!

Examples:
   /SET autolog OFF    - Sets value for setting 'autolog'
   /SET close          - Shows all settings whose variable name
                         contains 'close'. Very practical.
