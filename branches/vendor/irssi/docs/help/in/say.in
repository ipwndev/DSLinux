SAY <message>
(alias for "/MSG *")

The actual command used to put <message> into the current channel. A very
useful command if you need aliases for often used phrases.

For example: /alias brb say I'm off for a while, be right back.

This would allow you to use /brb to put the "I'm off*" into the channel.
