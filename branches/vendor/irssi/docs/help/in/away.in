@SYNTAX:away@

   -one 
   -all

This command marks you as being "away". It is used to tell people that 
you currently aren't paying attention to your screen. You might use it 
if you are taking a nap, in the shower, getting some food, or otherwise 
just aren't there at the moment. When you're "away" you will see "(zZzZ)"
in your statusbar.

Anyone who does a WHOIS on your nickname will see that you are away, 
as well as your away message. Anyone doing a WHO that returns information 
about you will also see that you're gone. 

By default, if someone sends you a MSG while you are away, your client 
will beep. You can turn this off by setting BEEP_WHEN_AWAY to OFF. 

If you send a MSG to someone who is away, you will automatically be 
notified of this. By default, you will only receive this notification 
once. If you wish to see it every time (to tell when a person is no 
longer marked away, for instance), change SHOW_AWAY_ONCE to OFF. 

You can remove your away status by using AWAY with no arguments.
