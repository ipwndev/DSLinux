@SYNTAX:list@

Lists the channel names. Trying to list all the channel 
names usually causes you to be disconnected from the 
server with the reason "Excess flood", as usually all
40000 channels form together and server naively attempts
to send you them.

Thus, on IRCNet, you should rather use service ALIS
(Advanced Listing Service), which will allow you to query
for channel with specific name, topic, mode or usercount.
Type /SQUERY ALIS HELP to get more info about it.
