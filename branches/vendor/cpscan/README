Thursday 11. August 2003.

I have taken over as maintainer, since freshmeat could not find the 
original owner. As a part of this, I've moved it to GPL'd release.
I suppose this is ok for most people, I suppose. If anyone should have 
anything to add: To late. I'm sorry, but you can't reverse a GPL.
I have however NOT taken over the copyright. I will claim claim copyright 
for any addment I made.

Note on translations:
I'm speaking english and Norwegian. This is the only languages I am going 
to make it in.
The portugisean translation that is, is going to be there, but 
umantained,unless I find someone.
NEW: Eliran Gonen has translated this program into french.

Install notes:
make clean;make;make install should do it. I recomend to manually modify 
Makefile to fit you. If something don't work, mail vidarlo@vestdata.no

THIS PROGRAM COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRAYNTY, EVEN FOR FIT TO A PURPOSE. USE 
ON OWN RESPONSIBILITY!
