<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
At the Mathomatic prompt, you can enter:

<ul>
<li>
a numerical expression, which is instantly evaluated and displayed,
<li>
an algebraic expression or equation,
which is stored and made the current equation,
<li>
a variable to solve the current equation for,
<li>
an equation number to select as the current equation,
<li>
a Mathomatic command (listed in this document),
<li>
a semicolon (;) followed by a comment
(everything on a line after a semicolon is ignored),
<li>
or an exclamation point (!) followed by a shell (or system) command.
</ul>
<p>
Mathomatic has about 35 different commands.
They are described below, in alphabetical order.
If the command is longer than 4 letters, you only need
to type in the first 4 letters for Mathomatic to recognize the command.
The command is not executed until you press the Enter key.
Most commands operate on the current expression or equation by default.
Some commands only operate on the current expression or
RHS (Right Hand Side) of the current equation.
<p>
Many commands have an "equation number range" argument.
An equation number range may be a single equation number,
a range of equation numbers separated by a dash (-),
or the word "all", which specifies all stored expressions and equations.
If a number is omitted, the current expression or equation is assumed.
<p>
A greater-than symbol (&gt;) may be appended to any command line,
followed by a file name.  This will redirect command output
to a file.  Two greater-than symbols (&gt;&gt;) next to each other
will <strong>append</strong> command output to a file.
For example:

<pre>
list export all &gt;filename
</pre>

<p>
will output all stored expressions and equations to a file in exportable,
single-line per equation format,
so they can be read in by a different math program.

<hr>
<a name="selecting"></a>
<h3>Selecting Equations</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>#["+" or "-"]number [new-equation]</b>
<p>
To change the current equation number,
type a pound sign (#) followed by the number of the
equation you wish to select.
If the number is followed by a space and a new equation,
the equation at the number is replaced with the new equation.
<p>
The equation number may be preceded by "+" or "-", to select
an equation relative to the current equation.
<p>
New feature: Selecting equations is now possible by just typing the equation number
at the prompt.

<hr>
<a name="solve"></a>
<h3>Solving Equations</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>variable-to-solve-for</b>
<p>
Mathomatic can solve the current equation for any single variable
or for zero.
Solving is usually accomplished internally by applying identical
mathematical operations to both sides of the equation.
The Mathomatic solve algorithm is the best possible for general algebra
and works perfectly.
<p>
To automatically solve for a variable,
just type the variable in at the prompt.
Mathomatic will proceed to manipulate the current equation
until all of the solutions for the specified variable
are determined.
If successful, the solutions are stored in the current equation
and displayed.
Cubic and quintic equation solving is not supported.
Quartic equations
(fourth degree polynomials)
can be solved if they are bi-quadratic
(only degree four and degree two terms).
<p>
To solve for zero,
type in "0" at the prompt.
Zero solving is a special solve that will always be successful
and will eliminate most divide operators from the equation.
<p>
To see all the steps performed during a solve operation,
type "set debug 2" before solving.
<p>
An example of solving:

<pre>
1-&gt; a=b+1/b

            1
#1: a = b + -
            b

1-&gt; b ; solve for "b"
Equation was quadratic.

                           1
        (a - ((((a^2) - 4)^-)*sign1))
                           2
#1: b = -----------------------------
                      2

1-&gt; a ; solve for "a", to check the answer
Raising both sides to the power of 2 and unfactoring...

        ((b^2) + 1)
#1: a = -----------
             b

1-&gt; simplify

            1
#1: a = b + -
            b

1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="calculate"></a>
<h3>Calculate</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>calculate [variable number-of-iterations]</b>
<p>
This command prompts you for the values of each variable in the
current expression or the RHS of the current equation.
It then simplifies the result and automatically substitutes "sign" variables
with all possible values, displaying each solution as it does so.
Nothing is modified by this command.
<p>
This command is used to approximate expressions
and expand confusing "sign" variables.
It is also automatically invoked when you type in a numeric expression,
without any variables, at the Mathomatic prompt.
No need to get out your calculator when you are using Mathomatic!
<p>
If a variable and number of iterations are supplied,
you will be prompted for the initial value of the variable,
and the calculation will be iterated, with the result
repeatedly plugged back into the specified variable.
<p>
Some examples of using the calculate command:

<pre>
1-&gt; y=x^2+x ; the simplest quadratic equation

#1: y = (x^2) + x

1-&gt; x ; solve for "x"
Equation was quadratic.

                              1
        -1*(1 + (((1 + (4*y))^-)*sign1))
                              2
#1: x = --------------------------------
                       2

1-&gt; calculate
Enter y: 0
Solution #1 with sign1 = 1:
 x = -1
Solution #2 with sign1 = -1:
 x = -0
1-&gt; a=b+1 ; an example of iteration

#2: a = b + 1

2-&gt; calculate b 10
Enter initial b: b
 a = b + 10
2-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="clear"></a>
<h3>Clear</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>clear [equation-numbers-or-ranges]</b>
<p>
This command clears equation spaces so that they can be reused.
The specified equations are deleted from memory.
<p>
"clear all" clears all memory, as if Mathomatic was restarted.

<hr>
<a name="code"></a>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>code ["c" or "java" or "python" or "integer"] [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command outputs the current or specified equations
in optimal C, Java, or Python language code.
The default is C code.
This output should compile correctly and emulate the equation from Mathomatic.
Just define and assign the independent variables used in the actual program.
<p>
With "code integer", integer arithmetic is assumed,
otherwise double precision floating point arithmetic is assumed.
"code integer" is more generic and should work with other programming languages.
<p>
To represent factorials, the user supplied function "fact()" is called,
since there is no equivalent function or operator in these languages.
"fact()" functions for several languages are supplied in the
directory "fact" in the Mathomatic source distribution.
<p>
Complex number arithmetic is not supported with C or Java,
however it is supported with Python.
<p>
For the most efficient code, use the <a href="#simplify">"simplify"</a>
and <a href="#optimize">"optimize"</a> commands on your equations
before running this command.

<hr>
<a name="compare"></a>
<h3>Compare</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>compare equation-number ["with" equation-number]</b>
<p>
This command compares two equations or expressions for equality.
If only one argument is supplied, the comparison is between
the current equation and the specified equation.
The comparison will be faster and more accurate if
both equations are previously solved for the same variable.
<p>
If this command says the equations or expressions are identical,
then they are definitely identical.
If this command says the equations or expressions may differ,
then they might be identical if
one of them is too hard for
Mathomatic to simplify completely.

<hr>
<a name="copy"></a>
<h3>Copy</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>copy [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command simply duplicates the current or specified equations
and displays them.

<hr>
<a name="derivative"></a>
<h3>Derivative</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>derivative [variable or "all"] [order]</b>
<p>
This command computes the symbolic derivative of the current expression or equation
with respect to the specified variable.
It does this by recursively applying the rule of differentiation for each operator
encountered and simplifying.
If it is an equation, the RHS is differentiated.
If successful,
the derivative is placed in the next available equation space,
displayed,
and becomes the current equation.
The original equation is not modified.
<p>
Specifying "all" computes the derivative with respect to all normal
variables.  It is equivalent to adding together the derivatives with
respect to each variable.
<p>
Specifying the order allows you to repeatedly differentiate all at once.
The default is to differentiate only once (order = 1).
<p>
Some examples:

<pre>
1-&gt; x^3+x^2+x+1

#1: (x^3) + (x^2) + x + 1

1-&gt; derivative x

#2: (3*(x^2)) + (2*x) + 1

2-&gt; a*x^n ; Show a general rule of differentiation.

#3: a*(x^n)

3-&gt; derivative x

#4: a*n*(x^(n - 1))

4-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="divide"></a>
<h3>Divide</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>divide [variable]</b>
<p>
This command is for doing and experimenting with polynomial, complex number,
and numerical division and Greatest Common Divisors (GCD).
Mathomatic has a symbolic polynomial division routine which
this command calls without any other processing.
<p>
This command prompts for
the dividend (the main polynomial) and the divisor (what you want to
divide the main polynomial by).  The quotient and remainder are displayed.
Then the GCD is displayed.  If just numbers were
entered, the LCM (Least Common Multiple) is also displayed.
The LCM is the same as the Lowest Common Denominator and
is the two numbers multiplied together, divided by the GCD.
<p>
A variable may be specified on the command line
as the base variable of the two polynomials,
but it is usually not necessary because Mathomatic
automatically selects a base variable.
<p>
The Greatest Common Divisor of "a" and "b" is defined as the greatest
number or polynomial that evenly divides both "a" and "b".
The Euclidean algorithm is used
by Mathomatic to compute the GCD for both
numbers and polynomials.
<p>
The GCD is the best way to reduce any fraction to its
simplest form.
Just divide the numerator and denominator by the GCD,
and replace them with the quotients (there will be no remainder),
and your fraction is completely reduced.
The GCD is also used when factoring polynomials and for simplifying.
<p>
The Euclidean algorithm of successive divides is the best way to compute the
GCD for numbers and univariate polynomials.
Multivariate polynomials usually require something more.
<p>
An example of polynomial division:

<pre>
1-&gt; divide
Enter dividend: (x^4) - (7*(x^3)) + (18*(x^2)) - (22*x) + 12
Enter divisor: (x^2) - (2*x) + 2

Polynomial division successful using variable (x).
The quotient is:
6 + (x^2) - (5*x)

The remainder is:
0

Polynomial Greatest Common Divisor (iterations = 1):
(x^2) - (2*x) + 2
1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="edit"></a>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>edit [file-name]</b>
<p>
This command invokes the editor specified in the "EDITOR" environment
variable.
<p>
Just type "edit" at the Mathomatic prompt to edit all equations
stored in the equation spaces.
When you are done editing Mathomatic equations and commands,
save and exit the editor to have them automatically read in by
Mathomatic.
If Mathomatic gets an error reading in its new input,
observe where the error is and continue, to
automatically re-enter the editor.
<p>
To edit an existing file and have it read in, just specify the file name
on the "edit" command line.

<hr>
<a name="eliminate"></a>
<h3>Eliminate</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>eliminate variables or "all" ["using" equation-number]</b>
<p>
This command is used to combine simultaneous equations.
It will replace all occurrences of the specified variables
in the current equation with solved equations,
essentially eliminating the specified variables from the current equation.
If you are eliminating only one variable,
the equation to solve can be specified using the "using" argument.
If the "using" equation number is not specified,
Mathomatic will search backwards,
starting at the current equation minus one,
for the first equation that contains the specified variable.
<p>
The equation to solve is solved for the specified variable,
then the Right Hand Side is inserted at every occurrence of the
specified variable in the current equation.
This effectively eliminates the specified variable
from the current equation, resulting in one less unknown.
<p>
There is an advantage to eliminating multiple variables in
one command: each equation will be used only once.
If the same equation is solved and substituted into the current
equation more than once,
it will cancel out.
<p>
"eliminate all" is shorthand for specifying all normal variables
on the command line.
<p>
Here is a simple example of combining two equations:

<pre>
1-&gt; ; This input to Mathomatic arrives at the distance between two points
1-&gt; ; in 3D space from the Pythagorean theorem (distance between two points
1-&gt; ; in 2D space).
1-&gt; 
1-&gt; l^2=(x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2 ; Distance formula for 2D space.

#1: l^2 = ((x1 - x2)^2) + ((y1 - y2)^2)

1-&gt; d^2=l^2+(z1-z2)^2 ; Add another leg.

#2: d^2 = (l^2) + ((z1 - z2)^2)

2-&gt; eliminate l ; Combine the two equations.
Solving equation #1 for (l)...

#2: d^2 = ((x1 - x2)^2) + ((y1 - y2)^2) + ((z1 - z2)^2)

2-&gt; d ; Solve to get the distance formula for 3D space.

                                                         1
#2: d = ((((x1 - x2)^2) + ((y1 - y2)^2) + ((z1 - z2)^2))^-)*sign2
                                                         2

2-&gt; ; The coordinate of point 1 is (x1, y1, z1) and point 2 is (x2, y2, z2).
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="extrema"></a>
<h3>Extrema</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>extrema variable</b>
<p>
This command computes the minimums and maximums of the current expression
or the RHS of the current equation.
The result is placed in the next available equation space, displayed,
and becomes the current equation.
The original expression is not modified.
<p>
"y=f(x)" where f(x) is the RHS, this command gives the values of x that make the
minimums and maximums of y.
This is computed by taking the derivative of f(x), setting it equal to zero,
and then solving for x.
<p>
The extrema of a function are simply the values of x when the slope equals zero.

<pre>
1-&gt; y=x^2

#1: y = x^2

1-&gt; extrema x

#2: x = 0

2-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This function is a parabola, with a minimum at (x = 0).

<hr>
<a name="factor"></a>
<h3>Factor</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>factor ["number" [integers]] or [equation-number-range] [variables]</b>
<p>
This command will factor manually entered integers
or trivially factor expressions in equation spaces.
<p>
"factor number" will prompt for integers to factor,
which may be up to 14 digits.
The integers should be separated with spaces.
Otherwise, the "factor" command
factors variables in the current or specified equations.
<p>
When factoring expressions, it does some basic simplification and
trivially factors out any common sub-expressions
it can, unless variables are specified on the command line,
in which case only common sub-expressions
containing those variables are factored out.
<p>
For example, with the following expression:

<pre>
(b*c) + (b*d)
</pre>

<p>
variable "b" factors out and the result of this command is:

<pre>
b*(c + d)
</pre>

<p>
If no variables are specified on the command line,
this command factors even more.
All equal bases raised to any power are factored.
This is called Horner factoring or Horner's rule.
For example:

<pre>
1-&gt; x^3+2x^2+3x+4

#1: (x^3) + (2*(x^2)) + (3*x) + 4

1-&gt; factor

#1: (x*((x*(x + 2)) + 3)) + 4

1-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
To undo the factoring, use the <a href="#unfactor">"unfactor"</a> command.
<p>
This command usually cannot factor polynomials.
To factor polynomials,
use the <a href="#simplify">"simplify"</a> command.

<hr>
<a name="flist"></a>
<h3>FList</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>flist ["factor"] [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command displays stored expressions in multi-line fraction format.
<p>
Non-integer constants are converted to reduced fractions,
if they are exactly equal to a fraction and it would improve
readability.
<p>
The "factor" option causes all integers, less than or equal to
14 digits long,
to be factored into their prime factors,
including the numerator and denominator of fractions.

<hr>
<a name="help"></a>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>help [topic or command-name]</b>
<p>
This command is provided as a quick reference.
If the argument is a command name,
a one line description and syntax of that command are displayed.
The command name may be abbreviated.
<p>
Entering this command by itself will display a list of topics
and commands.
<p>
To create a command quick reference text file, type:

<pre>
help all &gt;quick_ref.txt
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="imaginary"></a>
<h3>Imaginary</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>imaginary [variable]</b>
<p>
This command copies the imaginary part of a complex expression to the
next available equation space.
If the expression or RHS of the equation is not complex,
it will tell you and abort.
A complex expression contains both imaginary and real parts.
To copy the real part, see the <a href="#real">"real"</a> command.
<p>
The separation variable may be specified on the command line, the default is "i#".
<p>
If you want to exclude "i#" from the result,
type the following command after
the "imaginary" command:

<pre>
replace i# with 1
</pre>

<p>
For example:

<pre>
1-&gt; (a+b*i#)/(c+d*i#)

    (a + (b*i#))
#1: ------------
    (c + (d*i#))

1-&gt; imaginary

    ((b*i#*c) - (a*d*i#))
#2: ---------------------
       ((c^2) + (d^2))

2-&gt; replace i# with 1

    ((b*c) - (a*d))
#2: ---------------
    ((c^2) + (d^2))

2-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="integrate"></a>
<h3>Integrate</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>integrate ["definite"] variable [order]</b>
<p>
This command computes the symbolic integral of a function
with respect to the specified variable,
using the RHS of the current equation as the function.
If successful,
the integral is placed in the next available equation space,
displayed, and becomes the current equation.
The default is to compute and display the indefinite integral.
<p>
"integrate definite" also integrates, but prompts you for the lower and upper
bounds for definite integration.
If g(x) is the indefinite integral (anti-derivative) of f(x),
the definite integral is (g(upper_bound) - g(lower_bound)).
<p>
Specifying the order allows you to repeatedly integrate all at once.
The default is to integrate only once (order = 1).
<p>
This command is not very sophisticated and is only for integrating
polynomials.

<pre>
1-&gt; x^3+x^2+x+1

#1: (x^3) + (x^2) + x + 1

1-&gt; integrate x

    (x^4)   (x^3)   (x^2)
#2: ----- + ----- + ----- + x
      4       3       2

2-&gt; derivative x ; Check the result.

#3: 1 + (x^3) + (x^2) + x

3-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="laplace"></a>
<h3>Laplace</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>laplace ["inverse"] variable</b>
<p>
This command computes the Laplace transform of a function
with respect to the specified variable,
using the RHS of the current equation as the function.
If successful,
the transform is placed in the next available equation space,
displayed, and becomes the current equation.
<p>
This command only works with polynomials.
<p>
Inverse Laplace transforms are done with the "inverse" option.

<pre>
1-&gt; y=a*x^n

#1: y = a*(x^n)

1-&gt; laplace x

          a*(n!)
#2: y = -----------
        (x^(n + 1))

2-&gt; laplace inverse x

#3: y = a*(x^n)

3-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="limit"></a>
<h3>Limit</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>limit variable expression</b>
<p>
This command takes the limit of the current expression or equation as "variable"
goes to "expression", approaching "expression" from both sides.
"expression" may be anything, including infinity.
If successful, the current equation will contain the result
and be displayed.
<p>
L'Hopital's rule is not currently used by this command.
Instead the limit is taken by solving and substitution.

<pre>
1-&gt; ; Compute the derivative of (x^.5) using limits:
1-&gt; a=((x+h)^.5-x^.5)/h

                  1       1
        (((x + h)^-) - (x^-))
                  2       2
#1: a = ---------------------
                  h

1-&gt; limit h 0
Raising both sides to the power of 2 and unfactoring...
Removing possible solution: "h = 0".

            1
#1: a = ---------
              1
        (2*(x^-))
              2

1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="list"></a>
<h3>List</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>list ["export" or "maxima"] [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command displays stored expressions in single line format.
<p>
The "export" option allows display in exportable, single line format.
You can cut-and-paste the equations or redirect them to a file,
so they can be read in with a different math program.
"list maxima" is for making output compatible with the program Maxima.
<p>
This command simply outputs expressions and equations as stored internally by
Mathomatic.  There is no simplification and nothing more is done.
<p>
To display equations in fraction format,
see the <a href="#flist">"flist"</a> command.

<hr>
<a name="nintegrate"></a>
<h3>NIntegrate</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>nintegrate ["trapezoidal"] variable [partitions]</b>
<p>
This is a numerical integrate command and it will
not generally compute the exact symbolic integral
except for the simplest of expressions.
This command will prompt you for the lower
and upper bounds to perform numerical definite integration
on the RHS of the current equation with respect to the specified variable.
These bounds may be any expression not containing infinity.
<p>
Accuracy varies widely, depending on the expression integrated
and the interval.
This command uses Simpson's rule to do the approximation.
If "trapezoidal" is specified on the command line,
the trapezoidal method is used instead, which is usually less
accurate than Simpson's rule.
The way the trapezoidal method
works is the interval from the lower bound to the
upper bound is divided into 1000 partitions to produce 1000 trapezoids.
Then the area of each trapezoid is added together to produce the result.
This means that the accuracy decreases as the interval increases.
Simpson's rule uses the same method,
except parabolas are used, instead of trapezoids.
<p>
If the integration fails, chances of success are greater if
you reduce the number of variables involved in the integration.
<p>
If there are any singularities between the bounds of integration,
the computed result will be wrong.

<pre>
1-&gt; y=x+1

#1: y = x + 1

1-&gt; nintegrate x
Enter lower bound: 0
Enter upper bound: x
Approximating the definite integral using Simpson's rule...
Integration successful.

            (x^2)
#2: y = x + -----
              2

2-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This works because if g(x) is the indefinite integral (anti-derivative) of f(x),
the definite integral is (g(upper_bound) - g(lower_bound)).
In this case, it is (g(x) - g(0)), which is (g(x) - 0), which is
simply g(x).

<pre>
1-&gt; y=x^0.5/(1-x^3)

              1
           (x^-)
              2
#1: y = -----------
        (1 - (x^3))

1-&gt; nintegrate x
Warning: Singularity detected, result of numerical integration may be wrong.
Enter lower bound: 2
Enter upper bound: 4
Approximating the definite integral using Simpson's rule...
Integration successful.

#2: y = -0.162561171857

2-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This example avoids the singularity at x = 1 and is accurate to 12 digits.

<hr>
<a name="optimize"></a>
<h3>Optimize</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>optimize [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command splits the specified equations into smaller multiple equations
with no repeated expressions.
Each repeated expression becomes
a new equation solved for a temporary variable (named "temp").
Note that this command will only work if the whole expression (anything within
parentheses) is repeated.
It should work with partial expressions too, to be perfect.
<p>
To undo this command and substitute the split up equations into the original
equation, use the <a href="#eliminate">"eliminate"</a> command.

<pre>
1-&gt; y = (a+b+c+d)^(a+b+c+d)

#1: y = (a + b + c + d)^(a + b + c + d)

1-&gt; optimize

#2: temp = a + b + c + d


#1: y = temp^temp

1-&gt; eliminate temp ; undo the optimization
Solving equation #2 for (temp)...

#1: y = (a + b + c + d)^(a + b + c + d)

1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="pause"></a>
<h3>Pause</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>pause [text]</b>
<p>
This command waits for the user the press the Enter key.
It is useful in text files that are read in to Mathomatic.
Optionally, a one line text message may be displayed.

<hr>
<a name="product"></a>
<h3>Product</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>product variable start end [step]</b>
<p>
This command performs a mathematical product of an expression or the RHS of the current equation
as the index "variable" goes from "start" to "end" in steps of "step" (default 1).
The result is stored and displayed.
The current equation is not modified.

<pre>
1-&gt; y=a*x

#1: y = a*x

1-&gt; product
Enter variable: x
x = 1
To: 10

#2: y = 3628800*(a^10)

1-&gt; 10!
 Answer = 3628800
1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="push"></a>
<h3>Push</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>push [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command pushes the current or specified expressions into the readline
history, for easy editing and re-entry.
After this command, the pushed expressions are
accessed by using the cursor UP key.
<p>
This command only exists if Mathomatic was compiled with "readline" support.

<hr>
<a name="quit"></a>
<h3>Quit</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>quit</b>
<p>
Type in this command to exit
Mathomatic.
All equations are discarded.
<p>
To save your equations, see the
<a href="#save">"save"</a> command.

<hr>
<a name="read"></a>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>read file-name</b>
<p>
This command reads in a text file as if you
typed the text of the file in at the prompts.
The text file should contain Mathomatic
equations and commands.
"read" commands may be nested.
If any command or operation returns with an error,
the read operation is aborted.
<p>
Equations saved with the <a href="#save">"save"</a> command
are restored using this "read" command.
<p>
This command is automatically executed
when you start up Mathomatic with
file names on the command line.
<p>
The default file name extension for Mathomatic input files
is ".in".

<hr>
<a name="real"></a>
<h3>Real</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>real [variable]</b>
<p>
This command copies the real part of a complex expression to the
next available equation space.
If the expression or RHS of the equation is not complex,
it will tell you and abort.
A complex expression contains both imaginary and real parts.
To copy the imaginary part, see the
<a href="#imaginary">"imaginary"</a> command.
<p>
The separation variable may be specified on the command line, the default is "i#".
<p>
There will be no imaginary numbers in the result.

<pre>
2-&gt; (a+b*i#)/(c+d*i#)

    (a + (b*i#))
#3: ------------
    (c + (d*i#))

3-&gt; real

    ((a*c) + (b*d))
#4: ---------------
    ((c^2) + (d^2))

4-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="replace"></a>
<h3>Replace</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>replace ["constants"] [variables ["with" expression]]</b>
<p>
By default, this command prompts you for a replacement expression
for each variable in the current expression or equation.
If an empty line is entered for a variable,
that variable remains unchanged.
The result is placed in the current expression or equation and displayed.
<p>
This command is very useful for renaming or substituting variables.
It is smart enough to do variable interchange.
<p>
If variables are specified on the command line,
you will be prompted for those variables only and
all other variables will be left unchanged.
<p>
If "with" is specified,
you won't be prompted and all variables specified will be
replaced with the expression that follows.
<p>
"replace constants" substitutes pi and e#
in the current expression or equation with
their respective floating point values.
This allows them to combine with other constants and may help sometimes.

<hr>
<a name="roots"></a>
<h3>Roots</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>roots root real-part imaginary-part</b>
<p>
This command displays all complex roots of a given root of a complex
number.
The number of the root equals the
number of correct solutions.
For example, "3" would give the 3 roots of the cubed root.
This command will also convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
<p>
The real and imaginary parts of the complex number are prompted for.
Just enter an empty line if the value is zero.
The polar coordinates of the complex number are displayed.
Polar coordinates consist of an amplitude (distance from the origin)
and an angle (direction).
Then each root is displayed, along with an "Inverse Check" value,
which should equal the original complex number.
<p>
Since double precision floating point is used, the results may not be exact.

<pre>
1-&gt; roots
Enter root (positive integer): 3
Enter real part (X): 8
Enter imaginary part (Y):

The polar coordinates are:
8 amplitude and 0 radians (0 degrees).

The 3 roots of 8^(1/3) are:

2
Inverse Check: 8

-1 +1.73205080757*i#
Inverse Check: 8

-1 -1.73205080757*i#
Inverse Check: 8

1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="save"></a>
<h3>Save</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>save file-name</b>
<p>
This command saves all equations in the specified text file.
If the file exists, Mathomatic will ask you if you want
to overwrite it.
The saved equations can be reloaded at a later time
by using the <a href="#read">"read"</a> command.
You can edit the saved equations with your favorite ASCII text editor.

<hr>
<a name="set"></a>
<h3>Set</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>set [["no"] options]</b>
<p>
This command sets various options for the current session.
They remain in effect until you exit Mathomatic.
Typing "set" without arguments shows you the current option settings.
<p>
To change the default settings of Mathomatic,
put your set options in the file "~/.mathomaticrc"
("mathomatic.rc" in the same directory as the executable under Windows).
It should be a text file with one set option per line,
without the word "set".

<h4>Options:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
"set debug" followed by an integer sets the debug level number.
The initial debug level is 0, for no debugging.
If the level number is 2,
Mathomatic will show you how it solves equations.
Level 4 debugs the <a href="#simplify">"simplify"</a>
command and its polynomial routines.
Levels 5 and 6 show all intermediate expressions.
Set the debug level to -1 for suppression of unnecessary helpful messages.
<p>
"set case" will set alphabetic case sensitive mode, while
"set no case" will set case insensitive mode (all alphabetic characters
will be converted to lower case).
"set case" is the default.
<p>
"set color" enables color mode.
When color mode is on, ANSI color escape sequences are output to make
equations easier to read.  Requires a terminal emulator that supports
ANSI color escape sequences.
<p>
"set bold_colors" enables highlighting in color mode.
It makes all output brighter.
Use this if any colors are difficult to see.
<p>
"set columns" followed by a positive integer sets the number of
character columns on the screen.
When an expression is displayed in fraction format and it is wider
than the number of screen columns, single line format is used, instead.
"set no columns" does no checking for screen size and always
displays in fraction format.
In most cases, this value is set automatically on startup.
<p>
"set no display2d" will set the display mode to single line format,
instead of fraction format.
Single line format is useful when feeding Mathomatic output into another program.
An additional effect of "set no display2d" is constants will not be converted to fractions
(i.e.: 1/2 will display as 0.5).
By default, expressions are displayed in fraction format for easier reading.
<p>
"set preserve" will set "preserve_roots" mode, which suppresses approximation
of roots of rational numbers, if the result will be irrational.
For example, "2^.5" will remain "2^.5" in all Mathomatic operations.
<p>
"set true_modulus" will set true modulus mode, which is 100% mathematically correct.
Pseudo-modulus mode is used by default, which is the modulus used by computer languages.
Pseudo-modulus only gives the remainder of the division, which may be negative and
will sometimes fail the simplification rules employed by Mathomatic.
True modulus always gives a positive value or zero.
This mode only affects modulus operator calculations.
All true modulus simplification rules are enabled, regardless of this mode.
<p>
"set finance" sets finance mode, which displays all constants with exactly 2 digits
after the decimal point (for example: "2.00").
Displayed constants are always rounded to the nearest cent,
though internally there is no loss of accuracy.
<p>
"set factor_integers" sets automatic factoring of integers for all displayed
expressions.
<p>
"set directory" followed by a directory name will change the current working directory
to that directory.  This command can be shortened to "set dir".
</blockquote>

<hr>
<a name="simplify"></a>
<h3>Simplify</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>simplify ["symbolic"] ["quick"] [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command completely and automatically simplifies
the current or specified expressions or equations.
<p>
Use this command whenever you think an expression is not completely
simplified or if you don't like the way an expression is factored.
<p>
More than one option may be specified at a time.

<h4>Options:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
The "symbolic" option indicates ((a^n)^m) should always be reduced
to (a^(n*m)).
This removes any absolute value operations
((a^2)^.5 = a^(2*.5) = a^1 = a).
<p>
The "quick" option skips expanding expressions raised to the power of 2
or higher, like ((x+1)^5).
Algebraic fractions are kept simple (no fractions within fractions) only when using this option.
</blockquote>

<p>
This command applies some algebraic transformations
and then tries to reduce fractions by finding and dividing by the GCD.
Then smart (heuristic) and polynomial division are tried on any divides.
Polynomials with repeated or symbolic factors are factored.
<p>
Smart division is like polynomial division,
but it tries every term in the dividend,
instead of just the term raised to the highest power,
to make the expression smaller.

<hr>
<a name="sum"></a>
<h3>Sum</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>sum variable start end [step]</b>
<p>
This command performs a mathematical summation of an expression or the RHS of the current equation
as the index "variable" goes from "start" to "end" in steps of "step" (default 1).
The result is stored and displayed.
The current equation is not modified.

<pre>
1-&gt; y=a*x

#1: y = a*x

1-&gt; sum
Enter variable: x
x = 1
To: 10

#2: y = 55*a

1-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="tally"></a>
<h3>Tally</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>tally</b>
<p>
This command prompts for a value, adds it to a running
total, simplifies, displays the running total and average, and repeats.
No equation spaces are used.
<p>
It is a convenient way of adding, subtracting, and averaging many numbers.
Enter an empty line to end.

<hr>
<a name="taylor"></a>
<h3>Taylor</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>taylor [variable] [order] [point]</b>
<p>
This command computes the Taylor series expansion of the current
expression or RHS of the current equation, with respect to the specified variable.
<p>
It prompts you for the "point" of expansion, which is usually a variable or 0,
but may be any expression.
Use 0 to generate Maclaurin polynomials.
<p>
Then it prompts you for the order
of the series, which is an integer indicating how many derivatives to
take in the expansion (default is infinity, until the derivative reaches 0).
<p>
The result is placed in the next available
equation space, displayed, and becomes the current equation.
The original expression is not modified.

<pre>
1-&gt; e#^x

#1: e#^x

1-&gt; taylor x
Taylor approximation of current equation about x = point.
Enter point: 0
Enter order (number of derivatives to take): 10

            (x^2)   (x^3)   (x^4)   (x^5)   (x^6)   (x^7)   (x^8)   (x^9)    (x^10)
#2: 1 + x + ----- + ----- + ----- + ----- + ----- + ----- + ----- + ------ + -------
              2       6      24      120     720    5040    40320   362880   3628800

2-&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
<a name="unfactor"></a>
<h3>Unfactor</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>unfactor ["fully"] [equation-number-range]</b>
<p>
This command algebraically expands expressions.
<p>
"unfactor fully" will fully expand algebraic fractions.
Use this if just plain "unfactor" doesn't do enough.
<p>
Unfactoring is known as "expanding" or "multiplying out".
To illustrate what unfactoring does,
suppose you have the following equations:

<pre>
1-&gt; a=b*(c+d)

#1: a = b*(c + d)

1-&gt; z=(x+y)^2

#2: z = (x + y)^2

2-&gt; unfactor all

#1: a = (b*c) + (b*d)


#2: z = (x^2) + (2*x*y) + (y^2)

2-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
(x+y)^2 is converted to (x+y)*(x+y) and then multiplied out.

<hr>
<a name="version"></a>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>
Syntax: <b>version</b>
<p>
Outputs the Mathomatic version number and compile flags used.
