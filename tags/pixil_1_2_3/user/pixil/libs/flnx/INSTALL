Step 1: Make sure MicroWindows is compiled for your platform.
-------------------------------------------------------------

MicroWindows has very good INSTALL instructions.

Step 2: Compile FLNX Fast Light Toolkit.
----------------------------------------

Here's an example to do the compile:

If you are compiling for strongarm and my microwindows /src directory resides at:
/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/microwin/src, my strongarm libs reside at:
/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/lib, my strongarm includes reside at:
/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/include, and I want to install flnk includes and libs at: 
/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm, then this would by my configure:

A.	Type: ./configure --with-microwin=/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/microwin/src
	--libdir=/home/jeffm/lumberjack/libs/strongarm/lib
	--includedir=/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/include
	--prefix=/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm

	KEY:
	--with-microwin : Where your MicroWindows src directory resides.
	--libdir : Where platform libraries reside.
	--includedir : Where platform includes reside.
	--prefix : Where your want includes and libs to install
  	(i.e. the above, --prefix=/home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm, will install
	 /home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/include/FL/*.H,
	 /home/jeffm/lumberjack/strongarm/lib/libfltk.a, etc.)

B.	If your are cross compiling, set your compiler variables before make. These could include
	AR, AS, CC, CXX, GXX, LD, NM, RANLIB, or STRIP. For example, if I were compiling for the
	strongarm platform, I were using the skiff toolchain, and if I were using the bash shell,
	I would set the variables like this:

		export AR=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-ar
		export AS=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-as
		export CC=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-gcc
		export CXX=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-c++
		export GXX=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-g++
		export LD=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-ld
		export NM=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-nm
		export RANLIB=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-ranlib
		export STRIP=/skiff/local/bin/arm-linux-strip

C.	Type: ./make

Step 3: Test FLNX.
------------------

Go into your FLNX test subdirectory, which will contain various demos. Type ./demo to
make sure that it mostly works correctly (i.e. comes up in MicroWindows).

Happy compiling,
