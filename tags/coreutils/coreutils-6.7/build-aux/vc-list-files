# List the specified version-controlled files.
# With no argument, list them all.
# This script must be run solely from the top of a $srcdir build directory.

# If there's an argument, it must be a single, "."-relative directory name,
# with no trailing slashes.  In mercurial mode, it's used as part of a
# "grep" pattern (prepend "^", append "/"), and in cvs mode, it's simply
# used as an argument to the cvsu script.
# cvsu is part of the cvsutils package: http://www.red-bean.com/cvsutils/
