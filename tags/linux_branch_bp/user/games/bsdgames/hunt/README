What *is* hunt?

	Hunt is a multi-player search-and-destroy game that takes place
	in a maze.  The game may either be slow and strategic or fast
	and tactical, depending on how familiar the players are with the
	keyboard commands.

Distribution Policy:

	Hunt is part of the user-contributed software distributed by
	Berkeley in 4BSD.  The sources are copyrighted by the authors
	and the University of California.  You may redistribute freely
	as long as the copyright notices are retained.

Words of Warning:

	hunt uses the socket mechanism of 4BSD Unix, so if you are on
		System V (my sympathies), you're on your own.
	If your machine does not permit non-setuid-root processes to
		broadcast UDP packets, then hunt uses a *very* inefficient
		method for locating the hunt server: it sends a packet
		to every host on your network.  If your machine falls
		into this category, we strongly recommend that you use
		either standalone or inetd mode *and* start hunt by
		specifying the hunt server host.
	hunt can be configured to use Unix-domain sockets, but that
		code has not been tested in recent memory.  Also, since
		4.2BSD Unix-domain sockets are buggy, running hunt on
		4.2BSD with Unix-domain sockets will probably crash
		your system.  If you want to experiment, feel free to
		do so.  However, don't say I didn't warn you :-).
	hunt uses a fair amount of CPU time, both in user time (for
		computing interactions) and system time (for processing
		terminal interrupts).  We found that a VAX 750 can
		support about three users before the system is
		noticeably impacted.  The number goes up to about 8 or
		10 for a VAX 8650.  On a network of Sun 3/50's with the
		server running on a 3/280, things work much more
		smoothly as the computing load is distributed across
		many machines.
	hunt may be dangerous to your health.  "Arthritic pain" and
		"lack of circulation" in fingers have been reported by
		hunt abusers.  Hunt may also be addictive, and the
		withdrawal symptoms are not pretty :-)

Installation:

	1. Edit file "Makefile" and make sure the options selected are
		reasonable.  There are four "make" variables that you
		should check: GAME_PARAM, SYSCFLAGS, SYSLDFLAGS, and DEFS.
		GAME_PARAM controls what features of the game will be
		compiled in (e.g. reflecting walls).  The optional features
		are listed in comments above where GAME_PARAM is defined.
		If you want to try them, just add the ones you want to the 
		GAME_PARAM definition.

		DEFS is where most system configuration is described.
		If your system is 4.3BSD, Sun, Ultrix, Convex, HPUX
		v6.0.1, or SGI, you're in luck.  We provide the
		appropriate definitions for these systems and you just
		need to select one of them (e.g. if you have an Ultrix
		system, just change the line
			DEFS=	$(GAME_PARAM) $(DEFS_43)
		to
			DEFS=	$(GAME_PARAM) $(DEFS_ULTRIX)
		).  If your system is *not* listed above, then you may
		need to do some experiments.  All of the options are
		documented in the Makefile, be brave.

		SYSCFLAGS and SYSLDFLAGS are used for "unusual" systems
		and you probably won't need to deal with it.  An
		example of an unusual system is the Silicon Graphics
		IRIS, which keeps the network socket code in a BSD
		emulation library that is in -lbsd.  Edit these only if
		you *know* your system is "different."

	2. Edit file "Makefile" and look at the "install:" target.  By
		default, files are installed in /usr/games,
		/usr/games/lib, and /usr/man/man6, which are "standard"
		locations for games.  If your system has a local games
		directory, you'll need to change these.
	3. Edit file "pathname.c" and make sure the file names and port
		numbers are reasonable.  You can ignore the first set
		of variables as they are used only for debugging
		purposes.  The second set is used in the installed
		version of hunt.  The important variables are "Driver"
		(where the server is kept), "Test_port" (the Internet
		UDP port number that new players should use to contact
		the server), and "Stat_file" (where scoring statistics
		and body counts are written).  The only tricky variable
		here is "Test_port".  The default value is chosen so
		that it is unlikely to conflict with other service port
		numbers, but you can change it if you want to.
	4. Type "make install", which will compile and install the
		programs and manual pages.  Now you're almost ready to
		go (see next section).  There may be some warnings during
		compilation.  Ignore them.

Setting up the network:

	Hunt may be set up in one of three modes: standalone, inetd, or
	nothing.  In "standalone" mode, there is always a hunt server
	running on a server machine.  All players who enter the game
	will be talking to this server.  This is the mode we use at
	UCSF.  The cost is one entry in the process table on the server
	machine.  In "inetd" mode, the server is started via inetd.
	Again, only one machine should be set up to answer game
	requests.  The cost is having to edit a few system files.  In
	"nothing" mode, no server is running when there is no one
	playing.  The first person to enter hunt will automatically
	start up a server on his machine.  This, of course, gives him
	an unfair advantage.  Also, there may be race conditions such
	that players end up in different games.  The choice of which
	mode to use depends on site configuration and politics.  We
	recommend using "standalone" mode because it is simple to set
	up and starts up rapidly.

	-----

	FOR STANDALONE MODE, put these lines in /etc/rc.local on the
	server machine.  THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE SERVER MACHINE!

	# start up the hunt daemon if present
	if [ -f /usr/games/lib/huntd ]; then
		/usr/games/lib/huntd -s & (echo -n ' huntd')	>/dev/console
	fi

	Also, you should start one up (on the off chance that you will
	want to test this mess :-) by typing "/usr/games/lib/hunt -s".

	-----

	FOR INETD MODE, then things get more complicated.  You need to
	edit both /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf.  In /etc/services,
	add the line

	hunt		26740/udp

	26740 corresponds to the default "Test_port".  If you changed
	that variable, then you should put whatever value you used here
	as well.  In /etc/inetd.conf, add the line

	hunt	dgram	udp	wait	nobody	/usr/games/lib/huntd	huntd

	This works for 4.3BSD.  I don't remember the configuration file
	format for 4.2BSD inetd.

	See the huntd.6 manual page for more details.

	-----

	FOR NOTHING MODE, do nothing.

Testing:
	Now you are ready to test the code.  Type "/usr/games/hunt" or
	whatever you call the hunt executable.  You should be prompted
	for your name and team.  Then you should get the display of a
	maze.  At this point, you should read the manual page :-).

Hunt is not officially supported by anyone anywhere (that I know of);
however, bug reports will be read and bug fixes/enhancements may be
sent out at irregular intervals.  Send no flames, just money.  Happy
hunting.

P.S.  The authors of the game want to emphasize that this version of hunt
was started over eight years ago, and the programming style exhibited here
in no way reflects the current programming practices of the authors.
