# NL Keyboard Mapping  version 0.0.0.1
#
# From: wwessels@explore.demon.nl
# Date: 22/12/98 
# For an IBM 85 key international keyboard as found on a Thinkpad 765L.
# 
# This keyboard mapping is far from complete, I only have fixed the
# most irritating not working keys on the NL/IBM keyboard.
# I will try to fix all the keys if I have the knowledge and the time.
# 
# Best regards, Wouter.
#
# [slightly adapted - aeb]
# [corrections welcome - it seems unlikely that both Shift-9 and Shift-0
#  are parenright]
