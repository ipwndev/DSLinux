#Below is a keymap that I have customized for use with emacs.  Notably, I've
#enabled the alt-letter, alt-shift-letter, and ctrl-alt-letter keystrokes
#because they're all usable in emacs.  Also, I moved caps-lock to shift numlock
#and the left half of my keyboard has two control keys...(you can never have
#enough of them :)
