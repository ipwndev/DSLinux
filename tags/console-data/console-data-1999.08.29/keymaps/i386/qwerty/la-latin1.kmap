! Latin American keyboard, loosely based on Jon Tombs' and Julio Sanchez's
! Spanish keyboard. Read the Spahish and Keyboard HOWTOs for information on
! how to configure your system to use the extended symbols.
!
! shift keycode 41 is mapped to masculine because I wasn't able to
! figure out the correct keysym for that character. If you do, please
