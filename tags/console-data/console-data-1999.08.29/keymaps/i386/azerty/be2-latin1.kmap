#I've seen some (minor) differences between be-latin1.map and my own keyboard,
#so I send you the modified keymap.
#(the differences are twosuperior and threesuperior added(keycode 41), grave at
#the correct place(43), and changed the ^ on the numbers row (7) to have the
#same behaviour than in ms-dos)

# be-latin1.map modified by Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@f2219.n293.z2.fidonet.org>
include "be-latin1.kmap"

	altgr keycode 7 = asciicircum
keycode  41 = twosuperior  threesuperior
keycode  43 = mu  sterling  dead_grave
	alt keycode 43 = Meta_grave

# be-latin1.map has here:
# altgr keycode 7 = dead_circumflex
# keycode  41 = mu         sterling                dead_grave
# keycode  43 = <absent>
