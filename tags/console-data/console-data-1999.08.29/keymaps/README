If the below talks about /usr/lib/kbd, that may well be
something like /usr/share/kbd in other distributions.

The old setup had a directory /usr/lib/kbd/keytables containing
all keymaps. But this is getting messy - there are too many.
The present setup has a directory /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps with
subdirectories
	amiga, atari, i386, mac, sun
indicating the desired architecture.
(I believe alpha uses the i386 keyboard.)
The 386 directory is split further into subdirectories
	qwerty, qwertz, azerty, fgGIod, dvorak
indicating the layout of the letters.
(Very roughly speaking, qwerty is English, qwertz is German,
azerty is French, fgGIod is Turkish, dvorak is international.)
Loadkeys will first search /usr/lib/kbd/keymaps, and then its
subdirectories, so the default keymap should probably live in
/usr/lib/kbd/keymaps.

Many keymaps now use the include directive, both for clarity
and to save space.  One can avoid includes by doing
"loadkeys map-with-includes; dumpkeys > map-without-includes".
This may be desirable for the default keymap loaded at boot time.

I hope that this setup will make it possible for distribution
developers to make the keymap-choosing phase of a new installation
somewhat more user-friendly.
Note that one of the possible user choices should be *not* to
load any keymap, and get the compiled-in kernel default.
Note that only files *.map are candidate keymaps.
