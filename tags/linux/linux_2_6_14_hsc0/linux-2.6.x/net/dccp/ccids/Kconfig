	  CCID 3 denotes TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), an equation-based
	  rate-controlled congestion control mechanism.  TFRC is designed to
	  be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP-like flows,
	  where a flow is "reasonably fair" if its sending rate is generally
	  within a factor of two of the sending rate of a TCP flow under the
	  same conditions.  However, TFRC has a much lower variation of
	  throughput over time compared with TCP, which makes CCID 3 more
	  suitable than CCID 2 for applications such streaming media where a
	  relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.

	  CCID 3 is further described in [CCID 3 PROFILE]. The TFRC
	  congestion control algorithms were initially described in RFC 3448.
