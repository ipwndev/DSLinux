# Timer Interrupt Frequency Configuration

	prompt "Timer frequency"
	default HZ_250
	help
	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 HZ but 100 HZ may be more
	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
	 per second.


	config HZ_100
		bool "100 HZ"
	help
	  100 HZ is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems
	  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if
	  too many timer interrupts are occurring.

	config HZ_250
		bool "250 HZ"
	help
	 250 HZ is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
	 on SMP and NUMA systems.

	config HZ_1000
		bool "1000 HZ"
	help
	 1000 HZ is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.
