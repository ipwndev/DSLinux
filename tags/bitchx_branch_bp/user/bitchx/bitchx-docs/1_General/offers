Synopsis:
   offers <nickname|channel>

Description:
   OFFERS is a XDCC command used to list what people are file offering.
   The default is to check offers your current channel if nothing is 
   specified.

Examples:
   To see what your friend booya is offering:
      /offers booya

   To see what a channel full of people are offering:
      /offers #blah

Aliases:
   This command is identical to CTCP XDCC LIST.

See Also:
   ctcp(1)

Restrictions:
   This command makes use of CTCP (client-to-client protocol), which is not
   part of the IRC protocol.  Most modern IRC clients understand CTCP, but
   not all do, while others might not support the same CTCP commands that
   ircII-EPIC supports.  If you receive an error of some sort, then the
   client on the receiving end is unable to properly handle your CTCP
   message. This command will depend on the other clients running a xdcc
   offer script.
