Synopsis:
   back <back message>]

Description:
   This command marks you as being "back".  It is used to tell people that
   you currently back paying attention to your screen.  You might use it
   after you have taken a nap, a shower, gotten some food. When you mark 
   yourself as back, your status bar will show remove the value of 
   STATUS_AWAY to reflect this; this is "(Away)" by default.

Examples:
   To mark yourself away:
      /back I'm here right now

   send_away_msg; who(2); whois(2)

Restrictions:
   AWAY status (and messages) is only  through the network once,
   when it is first set.  The implication of this is that, if the AWAY was
   set during a netsplit, when the netsplit heals, the reconnecting servers
   will not be aware of the AWAY status.  Thus, anyone on those servers
   using WHO or WHOIS will not know you are away.  In addition, servers
   will impose a limit to the length of the AWAY message; this is usually
   80 characters; test it on your server to be certain.
