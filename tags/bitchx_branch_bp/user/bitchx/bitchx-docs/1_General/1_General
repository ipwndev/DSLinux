Section 1: General-Purpose Commands                                         

This section contains some of the most basic commands for EPIC.  If you are
not at least familiar with these, you probably won't get very far on irc.

Included here are commands for joining and leaving channels, connecting to
and disconnecting from irc servers, changing your nickname, sending private
messages to other people, and countless others.

Please read this section (and the next one) carefully.  Most of the problems
encountered by new users can be solved here.
