Description:
   DCC BOT initiates a direct connection to another client, allowing
   the users to chat without needing to pass messages through the irc
   network.  This is a very secure way of communicating on irc, not
   to mention that it is generally faster than sending messages across
   the irc network. A BOT connection is differant from a CHAT connection.
