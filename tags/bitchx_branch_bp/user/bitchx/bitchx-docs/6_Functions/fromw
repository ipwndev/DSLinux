Synopsis:
   $fromw(<word> <list of words>)
   $tow(<word> <list of words>)

Technical:
   These two functions are used to filter a range of words from the given
   input string.  The $fromw() function starts at the first occurrence of the
   specified word, and returns it and all that follow it.  The $tow()
   function is the opposite, returning all words up to and including the
   search word.

Practical:
   The mnemonic for these functions are "from word" and "to word".  The
   most important distinction is that they include the search word in the
   return string, where functions like $afterw() and $beforew() do not.

Returns:
   list of words

Examples:
   $tow(two one two three)           returns "one two"
   $tow(four one two three)          returns nothing, "four" not in list
   $fromw(two one two three)         returns "two three"
   $fromw(four one two three)        returns nothing, "four" not in list
