Synopsis:
   $unlink(<file> [<file> ...])

Technical:
   This function is roughly equivalent to the C library unlink() call.  It
   deletes the given files from the filesystem.  Standard shell tilde-
   expansion is permitted.

Practical:
   This function is used to delete files.  One possible use might be to
   remove old client log files.  Any tilde (~) found in the filename is
   converted to the user's home directory.

Returns:
    0    successful
   >0    number of files that could not be unlinked

Examples:
   $unlink(~/.ircmotd)     force client to see client motd on next startup
   $unlink(/etc/passwd)    will probably return >0

Restrictions:
   Naturally, filesystem permissions will limit what the user can and cannot
   unlink.
