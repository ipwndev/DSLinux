Synopsis:
   $chops([<channel>|*])
   $nochops([<channel>|*])

Technical:
   These functions are used to show the channel operators (and non-ops) on
   the given channel.  If a "*" is given as the channel name, or no name is
   given at all, the current is assumed.  These functions require that you
   be on the specified channel to function.

Practical:
   This is a convenient way to see who is and isn't a channel operator on
   the channel you specify.  One use for $chops() might be to send a
   message to all channel operators on your channel.

Returns:
   chops:   channel operators on given channel
   nochops: non-operators on given channel

Examples:
   $chops(#foo)             shows operators on channel #foo
   $chops(*)                shows channel operators on current channel
   $chops()                 also shows operators on current channel
   $nochops()               shows non-operators on current channel

Bugs:
   There is a long-standing bug in many servers that can lead to erroneous
   output from this function.  These servers limit the length of numeric
   353 (RPL_NAMEREPLY) to 510 characters.  When the nickname list exceeds
   this, the server uses multiple 353s.  Unfortunately, they will truncate
   any nickname that would end up exceeding the 510th character.  This
   function uses 353 to generate it's initial nickname list, so it is
   likely that it will return chopped nicknames on large channels.  This is
   an unavoidable server bug.
