Synopsis:
   $pad(<length> <char> <text>)

Technical:
   This function pads the end of <text> with <char> until it is <length>
   characters long. If <text> is longer than <length>, nothing is done.

Practical:
   This function is especially useful for forcing strings to a minimum
   length, possibly for a script that hooks and displays a /names reply.

Returns:
   <text> padded with a number of <char>s until it's length is <length>

Examples:
   $pad(8 ! test)                       returns "test!!!!!"
