Environment Settings Relevant to BitchX                                   

Numerous environment variables are recognized by .  Environment variables are
various settings that describe your login process on a Unix system.  How they
are set mainly depends on the command shell you use.

 * For csh and tcsh shells:
      setenv variable "value"

 * For bash, ksh, and zsh shells:
      export variable="value"

 * For sh (a true Bourne shell) and ash shells, and Bourne-like shells:
      variable="value"
      export variable

 * For the rc and es shells (Plan 9 descendants):
      variable='value'

For all shells (except rc and es), either single quotes (') or double quotes
(") may be used.  For all shells, the case of the variable is significant.
Environment variables are, by convention, in all uppercase, and BitchX is no
exception.  The following variables are used by BitchX:

   IRCNICK     default nickname when connecting to a server
   IRCNAME     any lunacy you want instead of your real name
   IRCHOST     default local host name to use on multihomed hosts
   IRCSERVER   default server list, space delimited, serv:port:pass ok
   IRCPORT     default server port to connect to
   IRCUMODE    initial user mode (does not work on all servers)
   IRCPATH     same as LOAD_PATH setting
   IRCRC       alternate startup file (in lieu of ~/.ircrc)
   IRC_SERVERS_FILE  same as compile-time SERVERS_FILE, specifies a file
                     to get a list of servers from

BitchX also uses the TERM and HOME variables, which are usually set when you
login to your Unix system.  All environment variables are available for
use inside BitchX as normal variables, assuming another variable of the same
name does not exist.
