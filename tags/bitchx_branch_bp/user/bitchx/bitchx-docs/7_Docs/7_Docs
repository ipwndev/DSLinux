Section 7: Other Documentation                                              

This section is for general information about BitchX, and about irc.  Most of
the documents contained herein describe a particular feature of the client
that may not be immediately obvious from the commands alone.  Others are
aimed expressly at new users, to help out when they're just getting started.
The major portion of the documentation was taken from the epic projects help
files, which was then modified for BitchX specifically.
