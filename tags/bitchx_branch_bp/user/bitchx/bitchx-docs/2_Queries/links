Synopsis:
   links [[<server>] <glob>]

Description:
   LINKS is used to display the servers currently connected to the irc
   network.  More precisely, it returns a list of the name each server
   calls itself.  For example, a Finnish server might present itself as
   *.fi instead of its full server name (for a variety of reasons which
   aren't really important here).

   If a server name is omitted, the client's current server is used.
   If a glob pattern is omitted, all servers are listed.

Examples:
   To list all servers in Australia:
      /links *.au

   To query all hostmasked Australian servers for a server with a machine
   name of "foobar":
      /links *.au foobar.*

See Also:
   load(5) tls

Other Notes:
   Servers using "dog3/super" patched code may disallow use of the LINKS
   command from time to time.  Such servers have a "high traffic mode",
   in which certain commands are disabled to conserve server resources.
   A 263 numeric will be returned if LINKS is unavailable.

   Some servers are now disallowing LINKS entirely, or limiting its use
   to irc operators (sometimes local operators only), as it is easily
   abused by "link lookers" and the like.
