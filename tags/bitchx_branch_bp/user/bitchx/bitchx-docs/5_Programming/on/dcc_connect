Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]dcc_connect [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client successfully establishes a
   DCC connection with another client.  Currently, this is either a CHAT
   or a SEND connection.

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of remote client
   $1    type of DCC connection
   $2    ip address of remote client
   $3    port on the ip address the client is connected to
   $4    file name (SEND only)
   $5    file size (SEND only)

Examples:
   To customize the connection message:
      on ^dcc_connect "*" {
         echo *** DCC $1 connection with $0[$2:$3] established
         if ( [$1] == [send] ) echo *** Transferring $4 \($5 bytes\)
      }

See Also:
   dcc(1); on(5) dcc_lost, dcc_request

Other Notes:
   Note that establishing a DCC connection does not involve the irc network.
   Thus, the $userhost() function will not work inside this hook.

   For a DCC SEND connection, this will be hooked twice. Once with $1 being
   SEND, and again being GET. This is for compatibility with bitchx.
