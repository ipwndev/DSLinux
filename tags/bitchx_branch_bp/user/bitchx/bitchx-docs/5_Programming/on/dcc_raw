Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]dcc_raw [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a raw message about
   a tcp connection established, or a connection attempt, with $connect().
   Raw messages are sent across established tcp connections with DCC RAW.

   Scripts that use sockets should always set a non-zero serial number for
   it.  Otherwise, it is very easy to set confusing or conflicting hooks.
   Each specific instance of a socket application should use a separate
   serial number, to prevent conflicts.

Parameters:
   $0    file descriptor for connection (returned by $connect())
   $1    host connected to (hostname or ip address)
   $2    code for connection type:
           c - socket was closed
           d - incoming data
           e - issued when $connect() returns successfully
           n - connection accepted on a port the client is listening to
   $3-   data for type 'd', port number for types 'e' and 'n', none for 'c'
           
Examples:
   To display all successful socket connections:
      on #-dcc_raw 10 "% % e %" {
         echo *** Connection with $1 on port $3 \(fd: $0\)
      }
