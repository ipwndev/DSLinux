Synopsis:

Description:
   XEVAL works just like eval, but with switches. The -server forces it to
   evaluate <text> with the context of another server as default. -window
   forces the output to be in a specific window.

Options:
   -server <refnum>  send all server output to server <refnum>
   -window <name>    send text to specified window (name or number)

Examples:
   To display colored text to window #2:
      set display_ansi on
      xeval -w 2 $chr(27)[34m This is Blue
