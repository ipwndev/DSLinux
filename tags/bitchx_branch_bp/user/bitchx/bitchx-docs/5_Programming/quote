Synopsis:
   quote <protocol command> [<arguments>]

Description:
   QUOTE is the client's mechanism for sending protocol commands directly
   to the server.  EPIC does not parse the input string in any (though it
   will expand variables as appropriate).  One recently popular use for
   this is to take advantage of Undernet's extended LIST capabilities.

Other Notes:
   The standard set of irc protocol commands are outlined in the Internet
   standards document RFC 1459.  Many protocol implementations, such as
   Undernet's, contain additional protocol-level features; consult the
   source code and/or documentation for such implementations for specific
   information.
