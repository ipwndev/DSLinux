Synopsis:
   set do_notify_immediately [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When this is set ON, the notify list is checked on every /notify command.
   Else, it will wait until the top of the minute to update. This was added
   primarily to speed up server connects, since so many people have huge
   notify lists which slow down an initial connection.
