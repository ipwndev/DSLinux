Synopsis:
   set comment_hack [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   This variable determines how the client will handle C-style comments in
   loaded scripts.  When turned on, it causes the client to only recognize
   such comments when they start at the beginning of a line.  When off,
   the comments may begin anywhere.

   This feature is present primarily to retain compatibility with scripts
   designed for older clients.  See the COMMENT help file for details.

Other Notes:
   This setting replaces the compile-time #define of the same name that is
   present in versions of EPIC prior to 3.001.
