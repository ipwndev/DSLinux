Synopsis:
   set eight_bit_characters [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting allows 8-bit characters to be entered on
   the input line.  Character sets that are 8-bit include Swedish, Finnish,
   Norwegian, and just about anything that isn't US-ASCII.  Note that an
   appropriate translation table must be used for the characters to be
   displayed properly.  Characters can be entered as digraphs, or with
   various meta keys, depending on the environment the client runs in.
