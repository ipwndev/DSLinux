   set continued_line [<text>]

Description:
   The text in this variable, if any, will be prepended to any lines
   printed that are wider than the display.  This is to provide a visual
   indicator that the line is part of the previous line, and not a new
   message.  This variable may be set in conjunction with the INDENT
   variable.
