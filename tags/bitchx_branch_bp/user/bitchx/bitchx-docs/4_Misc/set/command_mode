Synopsis:
   set command_mode [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this causes the client to behave somewhat like a MUD
   client.  The default input (when no command character is used) runs
   a command instead of sending text to the current channel or query.

   The normal leading "/" may be included with the command, but it is
   not required in this mode.  Additionally, if the leading character
   is a "'", the remaining text in the input buffer is passed as the
   argument to SEND.

   The client behaves normally when COMMAND_MODE is off.

Examples:
   To send a message to the current channel or query:
      send Hi there!
      'Hi there!

   To force a message to be sent to the current channel during a query:
      say Hi there!
