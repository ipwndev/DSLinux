Synopsis:
   bind <key> backward_history

Description:
   This replaces the contents of the input line with the previous command
   in the client's command history buffer.  The command history buffer is
   circular, such that using BACKWARD_HISTORY when at the first command
   will produce the last command in the buffer.  The original contents of
   the input line, if any, are not preserved.
