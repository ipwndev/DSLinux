Synopsis:
   bind <key> scroll_start

Description:
   This function causes the client to enter scrollback mode.  This allows
   the lastlog buffer to be viewed interactively.  Any server messages
   received while in scrollback mode are queued, and are not displayed
   until the client exits scrollback mode.  It is generally a good idea to
   set HOLD_MODE on while in scrollback mode.
