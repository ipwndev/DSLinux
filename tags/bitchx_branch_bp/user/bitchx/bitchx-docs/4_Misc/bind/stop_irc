Synopsis:
   bind <key> stop_irc

Description:
   This command causes the client process to temporarily stop, returning
   the user to the parent process that started the client (usually the
   user's command shell).  This is useful for executing commands that
   aren't well suited to EXEC.

Other Notes:
   Care should be taken with the length of time that the client is stopped
   for.  Unless it was originally started with the -S command line option,
   it will have no way of listening to the server.  This means that it
   could be disconnected from the server if it misses a PING message.
