Synopsis:
   window notify_level [<levels>]

Description:
   This works similarly to WINDOW LEVEL, except the levels specified
   determine what types of messages the client will report activity in
   that window for if WINDOW NOTIFY is on.  If no level is specified,
   the current level is displayed.

   The list of levels to use may be any of those allowed for WINDOW
   LEVEL.  A comma-delimited list may be used to specify more than one
   level at once.

Examples:
   To only show activity for private messages and notices:
      /window lastlog_level msg,notice

See Also:
   set(4) lastlog_level; window(4) level, notify
