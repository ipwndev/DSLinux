Synopsis:
   window double [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this causes the current window to use a "doubled" status
   bar.  In other words, the status bar is two lines high instead of one,
   allowing more information to be visible at once.  Each window may have a
   double status bar independently of the rest.
