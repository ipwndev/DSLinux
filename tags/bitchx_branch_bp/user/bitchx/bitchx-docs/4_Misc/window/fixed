Synopsis:
   window fixed [on|off]

Description:
   This toggles the current window's fixed status on/off. When a window is
   fixed, it can't be moved or resized by an operation on a separate window.
   All movements and resizes must explicitly be done on this window.
   
Practical:
   This is ideal for an Oper View type window, where it only sits and has
   data outputted to it (and therefore shouldn't be moved/resized)
