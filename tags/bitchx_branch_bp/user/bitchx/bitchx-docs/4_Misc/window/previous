Synopsis:
   window previous

Description:
   This sets the current window to the previous numbered window.  Windows
   are numbered sequentially, so if the current window is 3, this command
   will set window 2 as the current.  If the window happens to be the
   first in the list, the last becomes the current.  If the previous
   window is hidden, it becomes the current window by swapping itself
   with the old current window.
