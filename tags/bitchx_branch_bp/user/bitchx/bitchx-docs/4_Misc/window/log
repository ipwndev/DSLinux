Synopsis:
   window log <ON|OFF|TOGGLE>

Description:
   This controls whether or not the messages sent to the current window
   are written to an external logfile.  By default, the logfile name is the
   setting of SET LOGFILE (by default, "irc.log"), with the window's name
   appended to it (or, in the absence of a name, the string "Window#").
   Thus, if window 3 was called "foobar", the logfile would be called
   "irc.log.foobar".  If it didn't have a name, the file would be
   "irc.log.Window3".
