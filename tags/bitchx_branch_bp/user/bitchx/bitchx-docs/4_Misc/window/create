Synopsis:
   window create

Description:
   Depending on the environment the client is running in, this creates a
   new physical window.  The client must be running under the 'screen'
   program, or in the X Window System environment.

   'screen' is a popular Unix program used from the command line that
   allows for multiple virtual screens in a text-based environment.  With
   WINDOW CREATE, the client will create a new screen with ircII-EPIC
   running in it.

   X is the dominant graphical user interface used on Unix systems.  It
   is generally available only on Unix workstations with high-resolution
   monitors.  With WINDOW CREATE, a new xterm is started with ircII-EPIC
   running in it.

See Also:
   window(4) delete, new

Restrictions:
   Currently, when using this command in X, all xterms must be the same
   size.  The behavior of the client is undefined if an xterm is resized.

   This command is only available if the WINDOW_CREATE #define (found in
   window.c) was enabled at compile time.  It is not enabled by default.

Bugs:
   Use of this command is not recommended.  It has never truly worked as
   intended, and is rather unstable.  For this reason, it is disabled by
   default, and the method for enabling it at compile time has intentionally
   been kept vague.  Use WINDOW NEW instead.
