Synopsis:
   load meta1

Description:
   This simple script binds the backtick character (`) to META1_CHARACTER.
   This is mostly useful for people whose keyboard do not have an ESC key
   on them (believe it or not...).  The ` character can be produced by
   typing that key twice in a row.
