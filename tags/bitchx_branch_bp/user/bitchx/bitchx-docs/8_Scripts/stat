Synopsis:
   load stat

Description:
   This script supplies a single command, /stat.  It essentially does the
   same thing as LUSERS, except it returns the information in a somewhat
   more useful form.  It will return information for any server given, or
   the current if used with no arguments.

   It has been modified for use with EPIC by Jeremy Nelson (hop),
