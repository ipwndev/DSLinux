Synopsis:
   load tabkey.wc

Description:
   This script is similar to the original tabkey, except it is somewhat
   simplified.  The main difference is that nicknames are not automatically
   added to the nickname list whenever a MSG is sent or received.  Nicks
   must be manually added with /addmsg.

   This script was written by Brian Hauber (wc), bhauber@pobox.com..
