Synopsis:
   load away

Description:
   This script is a replacement of sorts for the standard AWAY command.  It
   works just like the builtin command, externally, but it doesn't actually
   interact with the server.  Instead, wwhen the client is marked away, it
   sends the specified away message to any client sending it a message, via
   CTCP.  It is smart enough to only send the away message once per person.

See Also:
   away(1); ctcp(1); load(5)

Restrictions:
   Due to protocol restrictions (and the client's enforcement of them), the
   away message is only sent in response to a MSG, not a NOTICE.

Other Notes:
   This script was written by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net.
