Description:
   This scripts consists of a set of hooks designed to mimic the look of
   the MODERN_ART setting found in ancient ircII clients.  It primarily
   computes the total number of items returned from WHO, LIST, and NAMES
   once they are finished.  It also places the nickname of the last
   person to MSG you in STATUS_USER in the status bar.

   This script was originally written by Carl von Loesch (lynx).  It was
   mildly updated by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net.
