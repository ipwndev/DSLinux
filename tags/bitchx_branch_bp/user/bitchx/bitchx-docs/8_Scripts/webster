Synopsis:
   load webster

Description:
   This script currently stands as an intellectual exercise.  When webster
   servers still existed, it connected to one at the University of Indiana
   and acted as a front-end to it, allowing the user to access the server
   from the irc client.

   At the time of this writing, there are no widely-known webster servers
   in existence.

   author explicitly allows this script to be distributed as freeware.
