Synopsis:
   load guh

Description:
   This script consists of a trio of functions, primarily aimed at fetching
   information about other clients.  Each relies on a server query, so they
   may not return the requested information immediately.

   The first is $whatchan().  It takes a single nickname as its argument,
   and uses WHOIS to try to return a list of channels that nickname is on.

   The second is $is_on().  It also takes a single nickname as its argument.
   If the nickname is currently on irc, it returns that nickname; it returns
   nothing if it is not in use.

   The last is $uh().  It takes an arbitrary number of nicknames as its
   arguments, and uses them as the input arguments for a USERHOST call.  It
   returns the output from USERHOST, usually a list of addresses, one per
   nickname.
