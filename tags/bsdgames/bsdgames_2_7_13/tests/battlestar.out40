Version 4.2, fall 1984.
First Adventure game written by His Lordship, the honorable
Admiral D.W. Riggle


	This is a luxurious stateroom.
The floor is carpeted with a soft animal fur and the great wooden furniture
is inlaid with strips of platinum and gold.  Electronic equipment built
into the walls and ceiling is flashing wildly.  The floor shudders and
the sounds of dull explosions rumble though the room.  From a window in
the wall ahead comes a view of darkest space.  There is a small adjoining
room behind you, and a doorway right.

>-: 
	These are the executive suites of the battlestar.
Luxurious staterooms carpeted with crushed velvet and adorned with beaten
gold open onto this parlor. A wide staircase with ivory banisters leads
up or down. This parlor leads into a hallway left. The bridal suite is
right. Other rooms lie ahead and behind you.

>-: 
	You are in what was once an elegant stateroom.
Whoever lived in this stateroom, he and his female companion
were mercilessly slain in their sleep. Clothes, trinkets and personal
belongings are scattered all across the floor. Through a hole in the
collapsed floor I can see a hallway below.  A door is behind you.

There is a strange golden amulet on the floor here.
