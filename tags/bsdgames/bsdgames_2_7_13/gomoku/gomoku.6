.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a two player game were the object is to get 5 in a row horizontally,
vertically or diagonally on a 19 by 19 grid.
By convention, black always moves first.
With no arguments,
.Nm
will display a playing board and prompt for moves from the user.
Valid moves are a letter for the column and a number for the row of an empty
board location.
Entering ``quit" or ``resign" will end the game.
You can save the current state of the game by entering ``save" and
supplying a file name when prompted.
The optional file
.Ar inputfile
can be used to restore a saved game.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
This option sets background mode.
Input moves are read from standard input,
the computer picks a move, and prints it to standard output.
The first input line should be either ``black" or ``white" to specify whether
.Nm
has the first move or not respectively.
This option was intended for game tournaments where a referee program handles
the board display and pits one program against another.
.It Fl c
Computer versus computer.
.Nm
will play a game against itself.
This is mostly used for testing.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
Repeating this option more than once yields more detailed information.
.It Fl D Ar debugfile
Print the debug information to
.Ar debugfile
instead of to the standard output.
.It Fl u
