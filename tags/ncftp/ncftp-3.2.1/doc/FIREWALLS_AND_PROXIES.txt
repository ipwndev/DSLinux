This version of NcFTP supports various FTP proxy servers.  Note that NcFTP
does _not_ work with HTTP proxies that accept FTP URLs.  Why?  Because they
accept HTTP requests, silly, not FTP, which this program does.  Examples of
HTTP proxies are Netscape Proxy Server, Squid, and Apache's proxy server.

To use the FTP proxy support, first build and install NcFTP.  Then run
"ncftp".  The first time it is run, it generates a $HOME/.ncftp/firewall
file.  Quit "ncftp" and edit this file with The One True (tm) text editor,
vi, or some inferior text editing tool.  :-)  Another way to print a copy
of the firewall configuration template is to run "ncftp -F > firewall".

You may have to experiment with various combinations of options in the
firewall file.  Ask your network administrator to assist you, if needed.
You may also find you must use passive, or perhaps must not use passive.
Use the "set passive off" or "set passive on" command from within NcFTP
to change this.
