Installation:

- Edit makeinclude and change what is needed. You can also look at
src/zfeatures.h to change very specific details (only useful to tune
TinySDGL to your needs). You can link the examples with either OpenGL,
Mesa or TinySDGL.

- Type 'make'. The library 'libTinySDGL.a' is copied into './lib'. The
examples are build in './examples'. Only the directories './lib' and
'./include' are needed to use TinySDGL from another program.
