	This option enables basic support for the SGI IOC4-based Base IO
	controller card.  This option does not enable any specific
	functions on such a card, but provides necessary infrastructure
	for other drivers to utilize.

	If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based
	I/O controller say Y.  Otherwise say N.
