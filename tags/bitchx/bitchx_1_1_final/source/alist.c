 * This file presumes a good deal of chicanery.  Specifically, it assumes
 * that your compiler will allocate disparate structures congruently as 
 * long as the members match as to their type and location.  This is
 * critically important for how this code works, and all hell will break
 * loose if your compiler doesnt do this.  Every compiler i know of does
 * it, which is why im assuming it, even though im not allowed to assume it.
 *
 * This file is hideous.  Ill kill each and every one of you who made
 * me do this. ;-)

 *	more ambiguous matches in addition.  The exact match's location 
 *	is put into ``loc'' and its entry is returned.  The ambigous matches
 *	are (of course) immediately subsequent to it.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is -1, then there was one exact match.  Its location is
 *	put into ``loc'' and its entry is returned.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is zero, then there were no matches for ``name'', but ``loc''
 * 	is set to the location in the array in which you could place the
 * 	specified name in the sorted list.
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is one, then there was one command that non-ambiguously 
 * 	completes ``name''
 *
 * If ``cnt'' is greater than one, then there was exactly ``cnt'' number
 *	of entries that completed ``name'', but they are all ambiguous.
 *	The entry that is lowest alphabetically is returned, and its
