Synopsis:
   m [=]<nickname> <text to send>
   m <channel> <text to send>
   m %<process id|process name> <text to send>
   m -<hostname> <text to send>

Description:
   This command has 3 primary functions; to send a private message to an
   individual, to send a message to a channel, or to send a message to a
   running EXEC process (usually a command of some sort).  You can specify
   multiple recipients for the message by delimiting them with commas (but
   no spaces), and you may even mix-and-match the types of recipients.

   Additionally, there are 3 special cases for recipients.  If you specify
   a single comma, ",", the message will go to the last person who sent you a
   M.  If a single period, ".", the message will go to the last person you
   sent a M to.  If you specify an asterisk, "*", the message will go to
   your current channel.

   Finally, you can make ircII-EPIC beep whenever you receive a private
   message by setting BEEP_ON_MSG to "msgs".  This is turned off by
   default.

Examples:
   To send a private message to your friend Buddha:
      /m buddha hi there!

   To send a message to your current channel:
      /m #channel how is everyone today?

   To send a message to a running EXECed process with id 2:
      /m %2 exit

   To send a message to your friends buddha, booya (with whom you have a
   DCC CHAT running), and channel #foobar:
      /m buddha,=booya,#foobar see you later!

   To send a message to an EXECed process named "mail":
      /m %mail x

Aliases:
   When sending a message to your current channel, MSG has the same effect
   as the SAY command.

   send_msg; query(1); say(1); send(5); set(4) beep_on_msg

Restrictions:
   The IRC protocol explicitly prohibits any client from sending any
   automated response to a MSG other than a NOTICE, and ircII-EPIC
   enforces this policy.

   The special cases for private MSG recipients, ",", ".", and "*", may
   not be specified with any other recipients (i.e. in a comma-delimited
   list), they must be used alone.  Attempting to do so will cause the
   client to not interpret them and assume they are literal nicknames,
   which will return a "No such nick/channel" error message.

   You may not send a message to any channel that is +n unless you are
   currently on it (and if it is +m, you must have +v or +o status).  See
   MODE for more information.

   Recent +CS servers (mostly used on EFnet) now restrict the number of
   people you may simultaneously send a MSG to.  The maximum is 20 people,
   though local operators will be warned if there are more than 10, in an
   attempt to curb irc "spams".  The /th servers are knows to behave in a
   similar manner. Hybrid6 servers have completely removed this capability.
