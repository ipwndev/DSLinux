   ctcp [=]<nick>|<version> version

Description:
   This command asks another client what the name and version of the
   client program being used is.

   version(2)

Other Notes:
   Some older ircII clients will return "SL0" in their VERSION reply.
   This stands for "Script Level 0".  It isn't seen very often anymore,
   but if you do see it, that's what it means.
