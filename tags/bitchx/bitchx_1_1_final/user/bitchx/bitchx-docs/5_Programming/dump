Synopsis:
   dump [all|alias|variables|on]

Description:
   This purges all aliases, variables, and/or hooks in the client's current
   memory.  This is useful if a script is not behaving as expected, letting
   the use dump everything and reload the script without restarting the
   client.  It is also useful for dumping any scripts that the client loads
   automatically upon startup.

   If no specific data type is specified, 'all' is used as the default.

Options:
   alias       purges all aliases in memory
   variables   purges all variables in memory
   on          purges all hooks in memory
   all         all of the above

Bugs:
   The client will not return an error message if an invalid type is given.
   In fact, it will report that the given type was indeed dumped!

Other Notes:
   This command does not affect the .ircrc or any other file in any way.
   It only affects the client's current state.
