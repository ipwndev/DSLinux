Synopsis:
   local [[-]<variable name>[,<variable name>] [<value>]]

Description:
   LOCAL creates "local" variables. Local variables are the same as assign(6)
   variables, except they're primarily for inside one specific alias. Local
   variables cannot be removed. There are several reasons for this, which are
   mostly advantages for scripts. A local variable is specific to the alias it
   was defined in, causing less confusion with multiple variables in multiple
   aliases. They are less cpu-intensive, making them optimal for recursive
   functions like for(5). Arrays may also be defined with local.

Examples:
   To give the local variable $blah a value of "this is a test":
      local blah this is a test

   To give both $blah and $foo a value:
      local blah,foo local vars are neat
