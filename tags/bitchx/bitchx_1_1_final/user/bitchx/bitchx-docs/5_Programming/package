Synopsis:
   package <name>

Description:
   The PACKAGE command allows a script to "group" all of the assigns, aliases,
   binds, ON hooks (and stubs) under a common package name. When the PACKAGE
   command is used, any alias/assigns/on that are registered until the end of
   the file are given the current package name. The package name can be changed
   anywhere in a script, even if PACKAGE had been previously used. However,
   packages only last until the end of the file, they never propagate
   upwards. Scripts that are loaded by other scripts may put themselves
   under a different package name than the one being used by the loading
   script. By default, a script is put into the package that is currently
   active in the script that loaded it (or * if no package is active)

Options:
   <name>         name of the package to group the current script under
