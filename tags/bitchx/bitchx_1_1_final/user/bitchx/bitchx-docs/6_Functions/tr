Synopsis:
   $tr(/<input>/<output>/<string>)

Technical:
   This function "translates" the input characters to the output characters
   in the given string.  Input and output characters are paired up in the
   order they are specified in (first-first, second-second, etc.).  If
   there are more input than output, the last output character will replace
   any input characters that do not have a corresponding output character.
   Any of the arguments may be variables or literal strings.  The delimiter
   does not need to be a '/'; it may be any character not found in the
   input or output characters.

Practical:
   This function is useful for doing very simple text encoding, such as
   ROT13.  It is also useful for stripping out unwanted characters from
   untrusted sources (such as shell meta characters).

Returns:
   "translated" string

Examples:
   /* assume $oldc is "aeiouy" and $newc is "yuoiea" */
   $tr(/s/z/efnet has bots)             returns "efnet haz botz"
   $tr(/$oldc/$newc/efnet has bots)     returns "ufnut hys bits"
   $tr(/$oldc/_/efnet has bots)         returns "_fn_t h_s b_ts"
   $tr(/abc//blah blah)                 effectively the same as $strip()
   $tr(#a#e#blah)                       returns "bleh"
