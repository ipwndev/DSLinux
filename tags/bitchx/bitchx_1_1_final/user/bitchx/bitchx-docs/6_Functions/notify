Synopsis:
   $notify([on|off serv <server number>])

Technical:
   This function provides an interface to the client's internal NOTIFY
   list.  If no arguments are passed, a list of all nicknames on the list
   is returned.  If the ON command is used, only those nicknames that are
   currently present on the given server are shows; if the OFF command is
   used, those not on irc are shown.

Practical:
   This function works in a similar manner as the NOTIFY command, except
   it has a return value.  This allows script to more easily manipulate
   the information.

Returns:
   nickname list

Examples:
   /notify hop crowman archon sheik
   $notify()                            shows current notify list
   $notify(on serv 2)                   shows who is on server #2
   $notify(off serv 5)                  shows who is not on server #5
