Synopsis:
   $delitem(<array> <item#>)

Technical:
   This function is used to delete an entry from an array created with
   $setitem().  If the item deleted is the only one present in the array,
   the array is deleted too.  If the item is not the last item in the
   array, all items beyond it (with higher item numbers) are shifted down
   by one to fill in the gap.

Practical:
   This function is used to delete items from an array.  The uses for this
   are pretty obvious.  If you add items to an array, it follows that you
   might want to remove them, too.

Returns:
   -2   if the item does not exist in the array
   -1   if the array does not exist
    0   on success

Examples:
   $delitem(array 2)             deletes item 2 from array "array"
   $delitem(fake_array 4)        error, "fake_array_ does not exist
   $delitem(array -2)            error, item -2 does not exist
