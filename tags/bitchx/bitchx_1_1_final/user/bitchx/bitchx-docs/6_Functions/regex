Synopsis:
   $regcomp(<regex pattern>)
   $regexec(<compiled pattern> <string>)
   $regerror(<compiled pattern>)
   $regfree(<compiled pattern>)

Technical:
   These functions are an interface to "regular expression" pattern matching:
   $regcomp() is used to "compile" a regular expression.  The return value
        is suitable for /assigning to an ircII variable.  Note that the
        return value of this function must be passed to the $regfree()
        function, to return the allocated resources for the compiled pattern.
        The compilation could fail: if you believe the compilation failed, you
        should call $regerror() to fetch the error.
   $regexec() is used to match a previously compiled pattern against a 
        text string.  The function returns 1 if the string is matched by the
        pattern, and 0 if it does not.
   $regerror() is used to fetch the error code for the most recently 
        attempted action on a previously compiled pattern.
   $regfree() is used to return the resources allocated to a compiled
        pattern.  Attempting to use a compiled pattern after it has been 
        passed to regfree is an error and may crash the client.  The
        function returns the FALSE value.

   If you neglect to regfree something that was returned by regcomp,
   then that will result in a memory leak.  The client cannot control this,
   and so if you use these functions, it is your duty to keep track of this.

   Passing a value to regexec, regerror, or regfree that was not
   previously returned from regcomp is an error and may crash the client.

Practical:
   Well, I can not give you any immediately practical uses for these functions.
   They are provided mostly for completeness because they were requested and
   they weren't that difficult to support.

Returns:
   $regcomp() returns an opaque r-value suitable for passing to the 
        other three functions.  The return value must be passed later to
        $regfree().
   $regexec() returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the match worked or not
   $regerror() returns the current error condition for a pattern
   $regfree() returns the false value.
