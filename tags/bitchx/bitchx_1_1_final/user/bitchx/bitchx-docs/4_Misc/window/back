Synopsis:
   window back

Description:
   This makes the most recent current window the current window again.  If
   that window happens to be hidden, it is swapped with the current window.

   WINDOW BACK is similar in function to WINDOW LAST, but differs in that
   it deals with the most recent current window; LAST deals with the
   windows in numerical order.  In other words, the previous window is not
   necessarily the previous current window.
