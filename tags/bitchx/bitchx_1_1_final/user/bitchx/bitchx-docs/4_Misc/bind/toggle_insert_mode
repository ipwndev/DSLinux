Synopsis:
   bind <key> toggle_insert_mode

Description:
   This toggles the client's default input mode between insert mode and
   overwrite mode.  In insert mode, text typed in inserted into the input
   buffer, shifting text following the input to the right, preserving it.
   In overwrite mode, text typed will overwrite any following text.  The
   mode is insignificant when there is no text following the cursor.

   This function is equivalent to setting INSERT_MODE to "toggle".
