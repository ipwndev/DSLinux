Synopsis:
   bind [<key/series> [<function> [<args>]]]

Description:
   BIND is used to bind a keystroke (or series of keystrokes) to a given
   function or command.  Traditionally, such key bindings have been used
   for cursor control and input line editing.  However, there really is
   no limit to what can be bound to a key.

   Most often, functions are bound to a control key (typing a key while
   depressing the control key on the keyboard).  EPIC provides a mechanism
   for overriding existing bindings to insert literal characters, by binding
   a key to QUOTE_CHARACTER.

   Using BIND with no specified function will display the function bound
   to the given key.  If no key is given, all bindings are displayed.

Examples:
   To bind the QUOTE_CHARACTER function to ^Q (control-Q):
      /bind ^Q quote_character

   To bind the right arrow (ESC-[-C) to FORWARD_CHARACTER:
      /bind ^[ meta1_character
      /bind meta1-[ meta2_character
      /bind meta2-C forward_character

Other Notes:
   Case is important with literal characters with BIND.  However, it is
   not important in control characters.  Thus, 'C' and 'c' are treated
   independently, but '^C' and '^c' are the same.

   Be careful when binding literal keys (such as 'c' alone) to functions.
   If the wrong keys get bound, it may be impossible to unbind them
   without restarting the client.
