Synopsis:
   set indent [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, long lines will be wrapped such that they are indented
   to the same position as the second word on the first line.  Subsequent
   wrapping of the same line will be indented to the same place.

   If CONTINUED_LINE is also set, the client will pad the wrapped portions
   of the line with the CONTINUED_LINE contents, unless CONTINUED_LINE
   happens to be longer than the indented space.  CONTINUED_LINE will not
   be truncated in this event; it is either displayed in full, or not at
   all.

   The client will never indent a line more than one-third the width of
   the screen when INDENT is enabled.
