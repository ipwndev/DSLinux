Synopsis:
   set auto_rejoin_delay <seconds>

Description:
   Automatically waits <seconds> seconds before rejoining a channel when
   kicked. Will only work if set(4) auto_rejoin is ON.

See Also:
   join(1); set(4) auto_rejoin; on(5) kick

Other Notes:
   Many channel operators don't like it if you rejoin too early. It is good
   netiquette to keep <seconds> above 4.
