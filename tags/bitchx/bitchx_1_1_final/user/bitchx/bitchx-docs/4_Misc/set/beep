Synopsis:
   set beep [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned off, this suppresses any audible beeps the client may try
   to use.  Any ^G processed by the client will be printed as a G.
   This setting will override the BEEP_ON_MSG and BEEP_WHEN_AWAY settings,
   and will effectively disable the BEEP command.

   If on, the client will audibly display all beeps normally.
