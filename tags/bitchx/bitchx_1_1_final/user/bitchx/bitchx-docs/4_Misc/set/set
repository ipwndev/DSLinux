Description:
   This command is used to set the value of one of EPIC's numerous internal
   variables.  These variables affect all aspects of the client's behavior,
   from enabling special text highlighting to enforcing strict security
   features.

   If no value for the given variable is specified, the current value is
   displayed.  The client will display all matching variables if the given
   is ambiguous.  If no variable name is given, all variables and their
   values are displayed.  If the variable name is preceded by a hyphen
   (-), the variable is unset, giving it no value.
