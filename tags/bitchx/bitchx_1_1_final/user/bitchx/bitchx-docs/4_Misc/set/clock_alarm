Synopsis:
   set clock_alarm [<time>|off]

Description:
   This variable sets an alarm that will go off that the specified time.
   The time format may be in either 12-hour (AM or PM) or 24-hour format;
   if no "AM" or "PM" is given, 24-hour format is assumed.  The alarm
   itself consists of a one-line message and a beep, repeated every 10
   seconds until the next minute has elapsed.  The setting of CLOCK has
   no effect on the alarm.
