Synopsis:
   load killpath

Description:
   This script primarily redefines how KILL messages (operator and server
   kills) are displayed.  It filters out most of the generally unimportant
   information (i.e. the kill path) to make the message more readable.

See Also:
   kill(3); kpstat(8); load(5); on(5) 436, server_notice

Other Notes:
   This script has been maintained and modified by numerous people over the
   years.  The original was by YeggMan.  Matthew Green (phone) modified it
   for compatibility with the then-new ircII 2.2.x clients, and Nicolas
   Pioch (Nap), pioch@poly.polytechnique.fr, made modifications for the
   then-new 2.7.x series of servers.  Ian Frechette (Daemon) later
   simplified it, and Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net, further
   simplified it for EPIC, such that it now has more lines of comments and
   credits than actual code.
