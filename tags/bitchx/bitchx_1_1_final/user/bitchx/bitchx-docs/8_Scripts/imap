Synopsis:
   load imap

Description:
   This script is designed to present the user with a topological view of
   the current irc network, from the perspective of any server on the
   network.  It contains 2 (two) commands that may be called directly:

     Command             Description                                      
     /gomap [<serv>]     displays the current server map; if a server name
                         | is given, the script will attempt to show the map
                         | from that server's perspective, else the current
                         |  is assumed
     /initmap [<serv>]   initialized the map database; the output may be
                         | limited to a set of servers if one or more server
                         | masks are supplied (as with LINKS)

See Also:
   links(2); load(5); map(2)

Restrictions:
   The script does not know how to deal with server masks gracefully (as it
   only relies on LINKS output).  The result is that the map may not be
   complete.

Other Notes:
   Undernet, and networks using ircu-based server code, provides a builtin
   MAP command, which does essentially the same thing as this script, only
   orders of magnitude faster, and is more accurate.

   This script was written by Ian Frechette (Daemon), with inspiration from
   Carlo Kid (Run).
