Synopsis:
   load recursion

Description:
   This script primarily serves as a working example of how to write
   recursive aliases.  The examples provided fairly suitable for everyday
   use (though only irc operators may use some of them).

     Alias         Description                                            
     /conbunch     CONNECT an arbitrary number of servers to current one
     /iterate      run given command once for each argument
     /kickbunch    KICK an arbitrary number of people from current channel
     /opalot       (de)op any number of people
     /squitbunch   SQUIT an arbitrary number of servers
     /versbunch    VERSION an arbitrary number of nicknames or servers

Examples:
   To ping several people at once:
      /iterate ping joebob jimbob toejam junebug

   To deop several jerks in the currentchannel:
      /opalot - jerk1 jerk2 jerk3 jerk4 jerk5

Restrictions:
   The MAX_RECURSIONS setting limits the number of times an alias may call
   itself.

Other Notes:
   The need for recursion has largely been depricated in EPIC with the
   introduction of FE.  This script was written by Ian Frechette (Daemon),
   frechett@spot.colorado.edu.
