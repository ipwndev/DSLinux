Synopsis:
   load autoop

Description:
   This script allows the client to automatically grant a user channel mode
   +o upon joining the channel, assuming the client has +o itself.  To help
   keep mode changes to a minimum, the script will wait 10-20 seconds
   before setting the mode.  Aliases are provided for adding and removing
   users and channels to watch for.
