Synopsis:
   load fe

Description:
   This is an example script that displays the power of FE, primarily how
   it can be used to avoid recursion.  It includes the following aliases:

     Alias       Description                                              
     /banalot    (un)bans any number of patterns from channel $0
     /botsweep   kicks everyone matching $0 pattern from channel $1 or $C
     /kickalot   kicks any number of users from channel $0
     /massdeop   deops all channel operators on $0 or $C (except $N)
     /masskick   kicks everyone from $0 or $C (except $N)
     /opall      ops all non-chanops on $0 or $C
     /opalot     (de)ops any number of users on channel $0

   A function is also included, $uh().  It takes an arbitrary number of
   nicknames are returns their corresponding addresses.

Examples:
   To ban several sites at once:
      /banalot #blah + *!*@*.aol.com *!*@*.gnn.com *!*@*.foo.com *!*@*.aq

   To deop a bunch of jerks on channel #foo:
      /opalot #foo - jerk1 jerk2 jerk3 jerk4 jerk5
