Synopsis:
   load spfix

Description:
   THis script contains a simple function that returns the input string
   with the first word stripped off, preserving any whitespace that
   precedes the second word.  This is necessary, because clients compiled
   with the STRIP_EXTRANEOUS_SPACES option will normally strip out the
   extra whitespace, which not everyone likes.  The function is called
   $spfix(), and may be given a string of any length.  Refer to the source
   code for more information.

Other Notes:
   This function was written by James Sneeringer (CrowMan), jvs@ocslink.com,
   regardless of what the source code says. ;)
