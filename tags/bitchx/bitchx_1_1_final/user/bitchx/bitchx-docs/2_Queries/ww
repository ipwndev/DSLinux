Synopsis:
   ww [<nickname> [<count>]]

Description:
   This command is similar to WHOIS, except it returns information about
   nicknames that were recently in use.  Like WHOIS, it shows the nickname,
   address, real name, and server.  It may also return multiple entries if
   the nickname has been used recently by several people.  These multiples
   may be limited by specifying a count to show.  A default for this
   number may also be set with NUM_OF_WHOWAS.

   WHOWAS will work regardless of whether the queried nick is in use.  If
   no arguments are given, the client's current nickname is used.

Examples:
   To show the last 5 users of the nickname JoeBob:
      /whowas joebob 5
