BitchX-1.1-Final Readme file by sin <sin@bitchx.org>
======================================================

BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka
panasync@efnet. BitchX was originally based on ircII 2.8, but is currently
based on the ircii-EPIC4 releases by Jeremy Nelson.

BitchX was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy
for the popular UNIX IRC client ircII. Around Christmas of 1994 the
script was patched directly into the client by panasync. 

Now in 2004 we are looking to revive the development of the client by merging
it back to the current release of Epic and cleaning some of the features
that are no longer needed or supported and moving on with the building of
a whole new client.  10 years of BitchX and we're not nearly done yet.

The new client will be based upon the final release of EPIC4 and will exclude
a great number of the old features such as support for OS/2 and GTK which was
very old and bloated plus there were problems with the gtk client causing
quite a hit to the CPU.  The upside is that the client will be pulled back
into a sane code base.  Less bloat and overhead is always good for you the
user.

For persons interested in becoming involved in the new project please visit
our forums website at http://www.cyberpunkz.org or join EFnet #BitchX.

A special thanks to panasync.
