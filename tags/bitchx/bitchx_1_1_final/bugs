[Drago(d@NULL.0x00.org)] we wanna hook /msg .name

<DavidW2> And there's a long standing bug.. a message from nick shouldn't go
          to the current window if that window is on a dufferent server than
          nick.. otherwise you msg nick and they're not there because they
	  are on another server

*note* this is caused by scripts and /xecho -C I believe.

<DavidW2> Notify signoff also go to the wrong window.. there seems to be a
          bunch of problems about where the output goes if you're on
	  multiple servers... the same nick@host was on 2 servers.. signed off
	  server1, but showed in server2's window :/

 6 [bestis(bestis@ls.sicom.fi)] some info to you msg log or something too:
the
          result of whois.arin.net has NS2.NIC.FRIII192.93.0.4 when doing
just
          echo $res.. and when putting that to the fe() it cores.. that I is
          tab? so i need to rip those out to prevent coredumps, but that
would
          be fixed in bx too.


<fudd> create a hidden window
<fudd> connect it to another server with /window server
<fudd> the switch back to window 1
<fudd> type /fprot off
<fudd> switch to window 2
<fudd> type it again
<fudd> switch back to window 1
<fudd> type it again
<fudd> the last time, its still echoed to window 2
<fudd> and so are all other client messages

[Catatonic(bjr@adsl-63-197-228-74.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net)] i found a bug i
          think.  /ov +hide, switch to the ov window, type /ov -hide and
then
          switch back to a regular window and type /ov -hide

<Lam> ok. i'm wondering how to check what window a channel is in, in case it
          isnt's the primary/on top channel in that window? chanwin()
doesn't
          do that
<Lam> as for $winlevel(), it would be nice if i have let's say
$levelwin(msg)
          returning the window to which msgs are redirected
