Synopsis:
   time [<server|nickname>]

Description:
   This displays the time of day, local to the server queried (thus, the
   time returned may not be the same as the client's local time).  If the
   server name is omitted, the client's current server is used.  If a
   nickname is given, that client's server is queried.

Examples:
   To get the local time of JoeBob's server:
      /time joebob

   To get the local time of server irc.foobar.com:
      /time irc.foobar.com

Aliases:
   DATE is identical in operation to TIME.
