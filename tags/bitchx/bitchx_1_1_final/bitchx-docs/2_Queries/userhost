Synopsis:
   userhost [<nickname> [<nickname> ...] [-cmd <command>]]

Description:
   This queries the server for the address (user@hostname) of the given
   nicknames.  Any number of nicknames can be specified.  If no nickname
   is given, the user's is used (this is one way for users to verify
   what address the irc server thinks they have).

   USERHOST also allows its output to be used as the input for other
   commands, using the -cmd flag.  When using -cmd, at least one nickname
   is required.  The command can be anything, and multiple commands may
   be used by surrounding them in curly braces.
   
   Also, if all specified nicknames are on common channels with the client,
   /userhost will get the address from an internal list, and never query the
   server. You are still 100% guaranteed to get the right user@host, but
   the AWAY and OPER flags won't always be accurate. If your script depends
   on /userhost for the AWAY and OPER flags, you can use -direct to always
   query the server.

   USERHOST passes the following arguments to -cmd:
     $0 - nickname
     $1 - a '+' if the user is an irc operator, a '-' otherwise
     $2 - a '+' if the user is marked as away, a '-' otherwise
     $3 - username
     $4 - hostname

Options:
   -cmd      take the output from /userhost as input to other commands
   -direct   force /userhost to query the server

Examples:
   To get the userhosts of JoeBob and Jimbo:
      /userhost joebob jimbo

   To use their userhost output as another command's input in a script:
      userhost joebob jimbo -cmd {
         echo $0 is $3@$4
         if ( [$1] == [+] ) echo $0 is an irc operator
         if ( [$2] == [+] ) echo $1 is away
      }

Aliases:
   HOST is identical in operation to USERHOST.

   userip(2); Expressions(7)

Other Notes:
   The server will only permit 5 nicknames at a time for this command.
   When more than 5 are given, the client will split the command up and
   issue separate queries as needed.  However, most servers enable their
   flood protection after receiving 5 of the same kind of command within
   a short time period.  This means that the user should expect a delay
   in response if more than 25 nicknames are specified.
