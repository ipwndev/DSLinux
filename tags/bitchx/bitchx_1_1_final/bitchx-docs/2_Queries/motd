Synopsis:
   motd [<server|nickname>]

Description:
   This is used to display a server's Message of the Day.  All servers by
   default will send this message to the client when it first connects to
   the server (though it is often not displayed by the client).  These
   messages typically tell a little about the server connected to, its
   various policies, who to contact with questions or problems, etc.

   If a server is specified, that server's motd is retrieved.  If a user's
   nickname is given, that user's server is queried.  Otherwise the
   default is the client's current server.

Other Notes:
   Users are encouraged to read the Message of the Day of any server they
   use.  In some cases, the server administrator may need to inform all
   users of something, and the MOTD is the most convenient way.  In any
   event, users should be aware of a server's policies if they use that
   server, as they will be held accountable for their actions whether
   they are aware of such policies or not.
