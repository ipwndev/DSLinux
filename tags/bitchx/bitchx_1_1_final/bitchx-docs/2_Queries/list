Synopsis:
   list [<switch> [<arg>] [<switch> [<arg>] ...]] [<channel>]

Description:
   This is used to list the channels that currently exist (i.e. that have
   one or more client on them) on the network.  The output will include
   the channel name (usually; see below), the number of users on that
   channel, and the channel's current topic.

   If an exact channel name is given, only information about that channel
   is returned.  If a '*' is used as the channel name, the current
   channel is used.  Otherwise, the client will request the entire list
   of channels.

   The client can search for specific channels or channels with certain
   characteristics.  If a glob pattern is given for the channel name, all
   channels matching that pattern are shown.  The list can be limited to
   channels with only a certain number of users, those with a topic set,
   or those that are private or public.  Multiple switches may be used at
   once.

   LIST output is affected by channel modes.  If a channel has mode +p,
   then its name will be masked in the list output.  However, it can
   still be displayed normally if the exact channel name is known.  If
   the channel has mode +s, then it will not appear in any LIST output,
   whether the exact name is known or not.  These limitations only apply
   to users not on the channels in question (i.e. a user on a +s channel
   can list that channel normally).

Options:
   -min <n>   shows channels with no less than n users
   -max <n>   shows channels with no more than n users
   -public    shows public channels only
   -private   shows private channels only
   -topic     shows channels with a topic set
   -all       overrides any previous -public or -private switch
   -wide      shows name and size using as little space as possible:
       -name     sort list by channel name
       -users    sort list by number of users per channel
                
Examples:
   To show channels with 3 to 15 users:
      /list -min 3 -max 15

   To show public channels with "help" in the name:
      /list -public #*help*

   To get a concise listing of channels with over 30 users, sorted by name:
      /list -min 30 -wide -name

   To see how Undernet's LIST works (and see below):
      /quote list help

Other Notes:
   Unless a specific channel name is given, the client will request the
   entire channel list and filter it locally.  This is noteworthy because
   large networks can easily have upwards of 2,000 channels at any given
   moment.  Parsing such a large list will greatly slow the client.

   This can be circumvented on the Undernet, and networks that use recent
   Undernet server code.  The protocol LIST command (which is not the same
   as the client's internal LIST command) on such servers has been
   expanded to allow for server-side filtering.  EPIC does not natively
   support this protocol enhancement, so the command "/quote list" must be
   used.  Use "/quote list help" for the exact syntax.
