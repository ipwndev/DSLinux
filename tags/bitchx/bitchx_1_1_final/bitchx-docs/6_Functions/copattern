Synopsis:
   $copattern(<pattern> <var1> <var2>)

Technical:
   Given a pattern and two variable names that represent lists of words of
   the same length, for every word in $var1 that is matched by the
   specified pattern, the corresponding word in $var2 will be returned.
   If the corresponding word in $var2 is absent (because $var2 is too
   short), then the empty string is substituted (i.e., nothing is returned
   for that word.)

Practical:
   When you have two variables, one that contains a list of control data,
   and another that contains a list of secondary data, and you wish to
   retrieve the secondary data, but you need to do it based on a query of
   the control data, you might use this function.  One possible use might
   be if one variable held your friends list, and another held their access
   levels.

Returns:
   word in var2 corresponding to indexed word in var1

Examples:
   @ friends = [bob@foo.com tom@bar.com]
   @ levels  = [20 10]
   $copattern(*@foo.com friends levels)       returns "20"
   $copattern(*@bar.com friends levels)       returns "10"
   $copattern(*@*.com friends levels)         returns "20 10"
   $copattern(*@*.net friends levels)         returns ""  (empty string)
