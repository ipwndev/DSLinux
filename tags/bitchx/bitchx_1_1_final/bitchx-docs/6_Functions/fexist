Synopsis:
   $fexist(<file>)

Technical:
   This function tests for the existence of the given file.  The function
   permits tilde-expansion.

Practical:
   This function is used when you want to see if a particular file exists.
   This could be useful to make sure a file is present before trying to
   load it.

Returns:
   -1   error, unable to access file
    1   file exists and client has read permission

Examples:
   $fexist(/etc/passwd)                   probably will return 1
   $fexist(~/.ircrc)                      probably will return 1 too
   $fexist(fake_file)                     returns -1

See Also:
   open(6)

Other Notes:
   This function never returns 0.  This is worth noting, because the natural
   tendency will be to check for the return value's existence, not its
   actual value (meaning it always returns "true", as far as the client's
   string parser is concerned).  This was done intentionally to match the
   return values of $fsize().
