Synopsis:
   $chanmode(<channel>|* [<channel> ...])

Technical:
   This function is used to retrieved the current channel mode for the given
   channel.  If no channel, or a "*", is given, the current is assumed.  You
   must be on the channel specified for it to function properly.  Multiple
   channels may be specified.

Practical:
   You give it a list of channels you want to know the channel mode for, and
   it returns the modes on that channel.  Of course, you have to be on the
   channel for it to make any sense.  You can use an asterisk ('*') to stand
   for the current channel.  If you don't specify any arguments, the current
   channel is assumed.

Returns:
   modes for specified channels

Examples:
   $chanmode(#blah)             returns modes for #blah
   $chanmode(#foo #bar)         returns modes for #foo and #bar
   $chanmode(*)                 returns modes for current channel
   $chanmode()                  returns modes for current channel too
