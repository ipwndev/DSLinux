Synopsis:
   $splice(<variable name> <index> <count> [<text>])

Technical:
   This function removes words from within a string, and then optionally
   replace them with something else.  It requires that a variable name be
   given, not an actual variable (meaning the '$' is omitted).  If no
   replacement text is given, the words are simply removed.  The index
   counts from zero.

Practical:
   This function is useful for changing parts of a string without
   rewriting the whole thing.  Used in conjunction with the matching
   functions, it can serve as a search-and-replace function that operates
   on whole words ($sar() operates on individual characters).

Returns:
   text removed from string

Examples:
   @ foo = [one two three four five]
   $splice(foo 1 3 foo bar blah)       returns "two three four"
   $splice(foo 0 2)                    returns "one foo"
   $splice(foo 2 1)                    returns "five"
   echo $foo                           shows "bar blah", end result
