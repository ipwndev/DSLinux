Synopsis:
   $remw(<word> <word list>)

Technical:
   This function returns the input list with the first occurrence of the
   given word removed.

Practical:
   This function is probably most useful in text parsing within a script.
   Because it only removes the first occurrence of the given word, and not
   all of them, it should probably be used in conjunction with $uniq() to
   be truly effective.

Returns:
   input list with first occurrence of given word removed

Examples:
   $remw(two one two three)            returns "one three"
   $remw(two one two three two one)    returns "one three two one"
