Synopsis:
   $version([<server>])

Technical:
   This function returns the given server's version class.  It may accept
   either a server name or a server number from the client's internal server
   list.  It only functions properly for servers that the client is
   currently, or has previously, connected to.  If a server is not given,
   the current is assumed.

Practical:
   This function is mainly useful for determining, in general, the type of
   server you're on.  It does not return the full server version.  Rather,
   it returns the class, or major revision number, of the server.

Returns:
    2.5        a 2.5.x server
    2.6        a 2.6.x server
    2.7        a 2.7.x server
    2.8        a 2.8.x server
   u2.8        a 2.8.x server, Undernet (mu/me)
    2.9        a 2.9.x server
   u2.9        a 2.9.x server, Undernet
    2.10       a 2.10.x server
   u3.0        a 3.0.x server, Undernet
   Unknown     version could not be determined

Examples:
   $version(2)                  get version for server #2
   $version(irc.foobar.com)     get version for server "irc.foobar.com"

See Also:
   version(2)

Other Notes:
   Some non-Undernet servers may nonetheless return "u2.8" as their class.
   This only means that the server in question is aware of Undernet's extra
   numeric replies.  These servers usually have ".me" in their version
   string.
