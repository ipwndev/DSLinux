BitchX is an extremely flexible client.  To borrow a phrase from many a C
programmer, it gives you enough rope to hang yourself.  With caution and
some common sense, this isn't a problem.

By far, the most potentially dangerous facility is ON.  Because hooks can
be set to activate on any arbitrary input, and because they can perform
most any action when activated, they are often used for malicious purposes.
Consider the following:

   on ^msg "% obey *" {
      $2-
   }

This allows anyone to make your client perform any command, simply by
sending you a message beginning with "obey", followed by any command.  On
top of that, you won't even see the message, and if the perpetrator is
careful, you won't see its output either.

Social engineering is also a problem on irc.  BitchX and EPIC attempt to 
combat this with special configuration settings that disable certain 
"dangerous" commands.  Of course, experienced users can disable these 
settings, but novices should think twice before doing so.

Above all, lack of education is probably the biggest problem associated
with the client.  Think twice before typing a command you aren't familiar
with.  Think twice before loading a script someone has given you, if you
don't understand how it works.
