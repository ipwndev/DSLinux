Hooking Server Numerics                                                     

In addition to the numerous named hooks provided by the client (refer to the
ON command in Section 5), BitchX and EPIC can hook any numeric reply sent 
by a server. They are treated no differently from named hooks.  Space 
constraints prevent a full discussion of all server numerics, not to mention 
that they tend to differ from network to network.

A small subset of commonly used numerics are provided for convenience.  A
mostly full listing can be found in the irc protocol specification, RFC 1459
(though you should look in the ircd source code for an exact list; they are
in the file s_err.c in standard ircd distributions).
