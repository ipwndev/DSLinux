Synopsis:
   load repeat

Description:
   This script is mostly an intellectual exercise.  It shows several
   different ways of writing a /repeat command, varying from FE, FOR, and
   WHILE loops to alias recursion.  All function the same:

     /repeat <count> <command>

   This causes the given command to be executed the specified number of
   times.  The current version even allows itself to be called recursively.
   Refer to the source code for more information.

Examples:
   To remind yourself to get off irc:
      /repeat 10 echo *** GET OFF IRC IT IS ROTTING YOUR BRAIN!!GGGG
