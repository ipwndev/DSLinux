Synopsis:
   load environment

Description:
   This script mainly serves as an example of the flexibility of EPIC's
   hooks.  It redefines most of them, named hooks and server numerics alike,
   to return a customized response.

   One neat thing it does is to automatically add any nickname detected by
   NOTIFY as a signon to an internal nickname list.  It uses the same
   method as the TABKEY and TC scripts (and in fact relies on them).  The
   nickname list is shared between the scripts.
