Synopsis:
   type <keystrokes>

Description:
   TYPE is used to simulate user keystrokes.  The arguments given to it
   are literally "typed" out in the input line, as though the user had
   typed them in.  Variables and bound keys are usually expanded, so
   XTYPE must be used to force literal display of the keys.

Examples:
   This will type out a "template" for the KICK command that allows a
   user to be kicked with a normal reason, plus a generic message appended
   to the kick reason (where ^[ is the ESC key; ^[b moves the cursor
   back by one word):
      type /kick FooScript C1996^[b^[b
