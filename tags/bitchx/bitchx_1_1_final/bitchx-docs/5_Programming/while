Synopsis:
   while (<condition>) <action>
   while (<condition>) [{ <action> }]

Description:
   The WHILE loop is a sort of hybrid between the FOR loop and the IF
   control statement.  It allows for repetitive action, as with FOR,
   but the loop iterates (performs the action) only if a specific
   condition is met, as with IF.

   The "condition" portion may contain any comparison or assignment
   allowed in an IF statement.

Examples:
   To display a warning message 3 times:
      @ xx = 3
      while ( xx > 0 ) {
         echo WARNING!  This ship will self destruct in $xx seconds!
         @ xx--
      }

   A infinite loop that behaves like the Unix 'yes' command:
      while ( 1 ) echo yes

Aliases:
   UNTIL is the exact opposite of WHILE.  It is essentially the same
   applying the negation operator (!) to the entire WHILE condition.

   fe(5); fec(5); for(5); foreach(5)

Other Notes:
   WHILE has all of the capabilities of FOR, only in a different syntax.
   The distinction between the two is not great enough to warrant a
   recommendation of one over the other.  If anything, FOR tends to be
   more concise than WHILE; however, this is not always the case.
