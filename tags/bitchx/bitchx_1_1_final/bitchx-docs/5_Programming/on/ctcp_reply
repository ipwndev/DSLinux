Synopsis:
   on [<modes>]ctcp_reply [<serial#>] [-|^]<match> { <action> }

Description:
   This hook is triggered whenever the client receives a CTCP reply from
   another client.  Note that the client doesn't necessarily need to send
   any CTCP messages to receive a "reply".

Parameters:
   $0    nickname of user sending reply
   $1    CTCP command being replied to
   $2-   actual reply to CTCP command (varies, depends on $1)

Examples:
   To customize the appearance of CTCP reply strings:
      on ^ctcp_reply "*" {
         echo *** Reply from $0 for CTCP $1 request: $2-
      }

See Also:
   ctcp(1); on(5) ctcp

Restrictions:
   Automatic replies (MSGs, CTCPs, NOTICEs, etc.) to the sender with this
   hook are explicitly prohibited.  The protocol disallows it, and the
   client will do everything in its power to prevent it.  Any attempt will
   result in an error message.

Bugs:
   There is no way (from within this hook) to know who the actual target
   of the reply is.  This could be a problem, since it is trivial to send
   bogus replies, and there is no way to tell if the client, or a channel,
   was the target.
