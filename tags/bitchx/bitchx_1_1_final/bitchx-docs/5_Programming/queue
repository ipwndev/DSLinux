Synopsis:
   queue [<flag>] <name> [<number>] [<commands>]

Description:
   QUEUE allows for a sort of batch processing in ircII-EPIC.  It is a
   convenient mechanism for preparing to execute a command at a later,
   undetermined time.  It can also be used as a sort of dynamically
   growing alias.

   Sets of commands may be stored into named queues; there is no limit
   to the number of queues that may exist, or the number of commands that
   may be present in a queue.  For queues with multiple commands, the
   commands must be surrounded by curly braces.

Options:
   -delete        delete the specified entry number in the named queue
   -do            runs the commands in the named queue
   -no_flush      does not flush commands (for use only with -do)
   -flush         flush the named queue without running the commands
   -list          show the contents of the named queue
   -show          show the contents of all queues

Examples:
   To add an item to the queue "foo":
      queue foo {
         echo This is a queued command.
         echo Isn't it cool?
      }

   To delete an item from a queue with multiple items:
      queue -delete foo 2

   alias(5)

Bugs:
   Error checking is not horribly tight with QUEUE.  Trying to confuse the
   client with multiple arguments that don't belong together will probably
   succeed.  Using multiple flags should be avoided whenever possible.
