Synopsis:
   switch (<control text>) { (<switch>) { <body> } }

Description:
   SWITCH is similar to C's switch statement.  It allows for multiple
   alternatives to a given "control" statement where more than two
   possible values exist.  It is functionally similar to IF except it
   doesn't require excessive nesting for multiple alternatives.

   Whitespace is not significant any any part of SWITCH.  Braces may
   appear anywhere, and multiple switches may appear on the same line
   or on individual lines.  No logic takes place inside the switch, only
   string comparisons.  For this reason, the expression parser is not
   needed (nor allowed), as everything is assumed to be a string, and
   variables are expanded.

Examples:
   A simple switch that checks the value of an arbitrary input:
      switch ( $0 ) {
         ( foo ) {
            <do action for "foo">
         }
         ( bar ) ( blah ) {
            <do action for "bar" or "blah">
         }
         ( * ) {
            <do action for everything else>
         }
      }

Restrictions:
   EPIC does not support a break-like mechanism, as one would find in C.
   This makes it impossible to implicitly simulate C's "fall-through"
   capability.  FE is better suited to the task of matching multiple
   independent strings.
