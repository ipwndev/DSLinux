Synopsis:
   kline [<seconds>] <user@host>,<user@host> :<comment>

Description:
   KLINE is used to ban a client from the irc server.  It works
   similarly to a KILL, except that a reason must be given (even if it
   is meaningless or flat-out wrong). Multiple user@host may be specified
   using comma's. The ":" specify's the comment. If a "seconds" arguement
   is given, then this becomes a timed KLINE.

Restrictions:
   This command is limited to irc operators.
