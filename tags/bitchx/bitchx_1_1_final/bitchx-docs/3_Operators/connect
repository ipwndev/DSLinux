Synopsis:
   connect <new server> [[<port>] <existing server>]

Description:
   This command is used to connect servers to the irc network.  It must be
   given at least one argument, the name of a remote server to connect to
   the network.  If only one server is given, it is connected to the
   client's server on the default port.  Alternately, a specific server
   and port may be specified.

   Wildcards are permitted in the server names, if they are unambiguous.

Examples:
   To connect irc.foo.com to your current server:
      /connect irc.foo.com

   To connect irc.foo.com with irc.bar.com on port 31337 of irc.bar.com:
      /connect irc.foo.com 31337 irc.bar.com

See Also:
   die(3); squit(3)

Restrictions:
   This command is limited to irc operators, for reasons that should be
   obvious.  Further, both servers must have appropriate C: and N: lines
   in their configuration to allow the connection.
