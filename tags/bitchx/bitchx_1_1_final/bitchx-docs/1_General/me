Synopsis:
   me <action description>

Description:
   ME lets you perform an action on your current channel.  It lets you
   describe what you're doing as though someone is watching you, rather
   than you telling them.
 
Examples:
   To perform an action:
      /me doesn't want to go to work today

   Anyone on the channel you sent the action to will see something like
   this:
      * foobar doesn't want to go to work today

Aliases:
   ME functions identically to using DESCRIBE to send an action to your
   current channel, as well as to CTCP ACTION.

See Also:
   ctcp(1) action; load(5) action, mudlike; describe(1); on(5) action,
   send_action

Restrictions:
   This command makes use of CTCP (client-to-client protocol), which is not
   part of the IRC protocol.  Most modern IRC clients understand CTCP, but
   not all do, while others might not support the same CTCP commands that
   ircII-EPIC supports.  If you receive an error of some sort, then the
   client on the receiving end is unable to properly handle your CTCP
   message.
