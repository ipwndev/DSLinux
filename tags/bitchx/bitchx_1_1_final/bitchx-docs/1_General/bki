Synopsis:
   bki *|<channel> <nickname> [<reason for kick>]

Description:
   This command "bans/kicks/ignores" the specified user off of the specified 
   channel. It is typically used to remove troublemakers, flooders, or 
   people otherwise making a nuisance of themselves on the channel.
   The reason for the kick is randomly taken from BitchX.reasons if not 
   given.

Examples:
   To kick foobar out of channel #blah:
      /bki #blah foobar Go away!

   To kick foobar out of your current channel:
      /bki foobar I said go away!!

See Also:
    ignore(1); load(5) autokick; mode(1); on(5) kick

Restrictions:
   KICK is limited to channel operators (users with channel mode +o; see
   MODE for more information) on the specified channel.

Other Notes:
   It is important to note that channel operators are the single absolute
   authority on their channels, and as such they may kick out anyone they
   choose for any reason (or no reason at all).  Keep in mind, however,
   that doing so for such petty reasons won't make you very popular with
   other users, and it isn't unheard of for users to abusively avenge the
   kick.  If someone is annoying you, using IGNORE (or SILENCE, if
   available) is a better solution.  KICK should be reserved for users who
   are harassing your channel or its members in general.
