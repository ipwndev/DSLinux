Synopsis:
   lastlog [-] [-<flag>] [--<flag>] [<pattern>] [<number of entries [<start>]]

Description:
   LASTLOG allows you to view messages that were on your screen at one
   time but have since scrolled off.  This is convenient is you aren't
   on a terminal capable of maintaining its own scrollback buffer, or
   if you accidentally used CLEAR before reading a message.

   LASTLOG only returns data saved in your client's lastlog buffer. 
   This is limited by both your LASTLOG setting, which specifies how
   many lines to save, and the LASTLOG_LEVEL setting, which says what
   types of messages to save.  It can return a specified number of
   lines, any lines which match a given pattern, or any combination. 
   Additionally, the output can be limited to a specific type, and
   multiword patterns are allowed (by surrounding the whole thing in
   double quotes), as are wildcards.

   If the first argument is a single hyphen (-), the output will not be
   surrounded by "Lastlog:" and "End of Lastlog" messages.

Options:
   -action        CTCP ACTIONs
   -all           all qualifying levels
   -crap          anything not covered above
   -ctcp          CTCPs (except ACTIONs and DCC stuff)
   -dcc           DCC connection and status messages
   -literal       search for a literal string
   -max <num>     only returns <num> matches
   -msg           private messages
   -note          NOTEs
   -notice        NOTICEs
   -opnote        operator notifications
   -public        public channel conversation
   -reverse       display the log backwards; from the END to the BEGINNING
   -snote         server notices
   -wall          WALLs (deprecated since WALL is no longer supported)
   -wallop        WALLOPs
   -userlog1 - 4  anything XECHOed under USERLOG1 - USERLOG4

   A double hyphen in front of a flag disables the output of that level.

Examples:
   To list all private messages from JoeBob:
      /lastlog -msg joebob

   To list all public messages from JoeBob in the last 100 lines
      /lastlog -public joebob 100

   To list all occurrences of the phrase "ircII-EPIC is cool" from 100
   to 600 lines ago:
      /lastlog "ircII-EPIC is cool" 100 500

   To list everything *except* messages:
      /lastlog -all --msgs
