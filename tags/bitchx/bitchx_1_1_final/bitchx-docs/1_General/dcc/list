Synopsis:
   dcc list

Description:
   This displays all current and pending DCC connections in a table format.
   The data listed includes the type of DCC connection, the remote client
   nickname, status (whether it has actually started or not), when the
   connection began (if at all), how much data has been transferred over
   the link, and any extra arguments present (such as the name of a file
   being transferred between clients). Two differant types of display may
   be chosen for displaying the information displayed.

Examples:
   To show a list of current DCC connections:
      /dcc list

Aliases:
   DCC LIST operates the same as DCC with no arguments.

See Also:

Other Notes:
   For file transfers, LIST will show the filename being transferred.
   Display of the full path can be toggled with DCC SHOWPATHS.
