Synopsis:
   set send_ignore_msg [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, any ignored user that sends a private message to the
   client will be sent a notice stating that the user is being ignored.
   When turned off, the user is not made aware of the IGNORE setting.

See Also:
   ignore(1)

Other Notes:
   Caution should be exercised with this setting.  If the user is being
   ignored for flooding, the automated notices sent by the client may
   very well flood the client off irc.  Unless there is a compelling
   reason to do otherwise, this setting should be turned off.
