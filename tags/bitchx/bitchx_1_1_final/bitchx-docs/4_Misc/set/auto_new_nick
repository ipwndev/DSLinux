Synopsis:
   set auto_new_nick [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, this setting will cause the client to try to auto-
   matically generate a new nickname during connection to a server if the
   default choice is not available.  The new nickname is based on the
   chosen nickname, and the client may try up to 9 to 17 variations of it
   before giving up and prompting for a new nickname to be typed in.

   If it is turned off, the client will always prompt for a new nickname
   to be typed in if the client cannot use the default choice.
