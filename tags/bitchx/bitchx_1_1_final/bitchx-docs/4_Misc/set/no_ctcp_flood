Synopsis:
   set no_ctcp_flood [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will only return at most one CTCP reply every
   2 (two) seconds to any particular nickname.  Additional CTCP requests
   within that time frame are simply ignored.

See Also:
   ctcp(1); ignore(1)

Other Notes:
   The client checks this variable on a per-nickname basis.  This makes it
   ineffective when being flooded by multiple clients in concert.
