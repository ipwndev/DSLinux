Synopsis:
   set show_who_hopcount [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the number of server hops from the client to each user
   in WHO output is shown.  When turned off, it is suppressed.  The only
   reason one might turn it off for is that it can be confusing to new
   users.
