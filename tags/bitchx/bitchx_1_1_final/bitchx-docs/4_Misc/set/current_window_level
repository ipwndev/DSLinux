Synopsis:
   set current_window_level [<lastlog levels>]

Description:
   This variable takes a lastlog level description (eg. "MSGS,PUBLIC,CRAP")
   which defines which levels are redirected to the current window. This
   means all output with the levels in this variable are *NOT* sent to
   their regular window, but the current window instead.
   
Example:
   To send all output with the level "CRAP" to the current window:
      /set current_window_level CRAP
