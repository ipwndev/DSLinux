Synopsis:
   window [<refnum>] [<command> [<arguments> ...]]

Description:
   The WINDOW command allows the client to display multiple "windows" of
   irc activity at once.  Some common uses for this include using
   separate windows for different channels, or for connecting to several
   servers at the same time.

   There are two different types of windows.  The first, and the more
   widely used of the two, are ircII windows.  These work by splitting
   the screen vertically, such that there are multiple panes stacked on
   top of one another.  Each window has its own status bar, which is
   what separates them.

   The second variety is less common, and depends largely on the
   environment in which the client is launched.  The client is able to
   interface with the X Window System, and with the terminal SCREEN
   program.  Under X, the client can spawn a new xterm with a client
   running in it.  Under SCREEN, a new screen is created with similar
   properties.

   In practice, the first type are the only windows used.  Most of the
   various WINDOW commands deal with them.  They are also considerably
   more stable than the second type.

Other Notes:
   On some systems, support for the second type of window (X/SCREEN) is
   not even compiled into the client.  It's use is discouraged except
   for debugging purposes, as it may well crash the client, or worse.
   It is not expected to be supported in future versions. If <refnum>
   is given, all <commands> will be executed on that window.
