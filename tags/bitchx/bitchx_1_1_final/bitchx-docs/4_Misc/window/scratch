Synopsis:
   window scratch <on|off>

Description:
   When a window is defined as being a scratch window, it is accessed very
   differently. Scratch windows do not scroll, and allow direct line-by-line
   accessing. To allow this, a new flag has been added to xecho: -line.

Examples:
   To create a scratch window, and add some text to it:
      /window new scratch on fixed on discon
              /* creates a non-movable, non-serverable scratch window */
      /xecho -window <refnum> -line 1 This is in the scratch window.

See Also:
   xecho(5)

Other Notes:
   Scratch windows don't deal with being resized very gracefully. It is
   suggested that you do /WINDOW NEW SCRATCH ON FIXED ON so that it can't be
   resized on you. Scratch windows are best not bound to a server, always use
   window(4) discon. Scratch windows have no scrollback, due to their
   direct accessing.
