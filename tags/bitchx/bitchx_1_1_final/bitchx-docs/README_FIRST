How to use the BitchX/EPIC help system

++ New users should use "/ehelp 7 new_user" before proceeding further. ++

The basic system has not changed from previous releases of the client.
What has changed is the structure of the helpfiles, and the helpfiles
themselves.  Helpfiles are now organized in logical groups of commands,
similar to the Unix manual system.

  Section 1: General Commands           Section 5: Programming BitchX
  Section 2: Server Queries             Section 6: Builtin Functions
  Section 3: IRC Operator Commands      Section 7: Documentation
  Section 4: Miscellaneous Commands     Section 8: Script Library

The implication of this, however, is that HELP can't work the same way
as it used to.  In order to read a helpfile now, its section number must
also be given.  Thus, where one previously obtained help on WHOIS with
"/help whois", one must now use "/help 2 whois".

Another change is the references to related topics in individual helpfiles,
which is another similarity to Unix man pages.  To better help users ease
into the new format, all topic references in the "See Also" sections will
include a Unix-ish section reference, such as "whois(2)".

Also if your familar with a command and you find that it's not listed in
here, please write a description of it and email it to
edwards@bitchx.dimension6.com. Your input here, might help someone else.
