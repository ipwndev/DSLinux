Control your ship and avoid the barrage.
A ship is not destroyed even if it contacts an enemy main body.
A ship becomes slow while holding the slowdown key.

A green star is the bonus item.
A score of the item(displayed at the left-up corner) increases 
if you get items continuously.

When all ships are destroyed, the game is over.
The ship extends 200,000 and every 500,000 points.

These command line options are available:
 -nosound       Stop the sound.
 -window        Launch the game in the window, not use the full-screen.
 -reverse       Reverse the fire key and the slowdown key.
 -brightness n  Set the brightness of the sceen(n=0-256).
 -accframe      Use the alternative framerate management algorithm.
                (If you have a problem with framerate, try this option.)

- Add your original barrage patterns.

You can add your own barrage patterns to Noiz2sa.
In the 'noiz2sa' directory, there are 3 directories named
'zako', 'middle' and 'boss'.
In these directories, the barrage pattern files are placed.

The barrage pattern files are written by BulletML.
About BulletML, see the page:

BulletML
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html

A 'zako' directory is for the small enemies.
A 'middle' directory is for the middle class enemies.
A 'boss' directory is for the boss type enemies.

You should adjust the difficulty of the barrage
by using a $rank variable properly.
A $rank variable is used to control the difficulty
of each scene in Noiz2sa.
