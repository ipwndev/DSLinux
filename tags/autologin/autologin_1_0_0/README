What is it?
===========
Autologin is a tool that lets you bypass the login screens on a unix system.
It needs to be installed and configured by root (it is definitely not a
cracking tool ;) ).
Possible uses include providing a simple end-user system as well as creating
a one-purpose (e.g. web browsing) station that returns to where it's supposed
to be after a reboot or power outage without any intervention.

autologin affects only local users - it doesn't open up any leaks for crackers
from the outside world.


How is it configured?
=====================
Create the file /etc/sysconfig/autologin, containing the following settings:

USER=[username]
	Start the session as the user specified here.
	This setting is mandatory. If omitted, autologin will not run.
	If autologin was compiled with --enable-paranoid, autologin will
	not run if the user specified has UID or GID 0.
EXEC=[script or program]
	The script or program listed here will be executed as the user
	specified above.
	If this setting is omitted, /usr/X11R6/bin/startx will be used.
AUTOLOGIN={yes,no}
	You can use this setting to turn off autologin even if it is
	installed and the config file exists and is considered safe.
	If this setting is omitted, "yes" is assumed.

/etc/sysconfig/autologin must not be writable by anyone but root. If it is,
it is detected as a possible cracking attempt and autologin will not run.


Do I need to do anything else?
==============================
Yes - you need to have runlevel 5 start autologin. Starting from the
initscripts 5.15 package, Red Hat Linux does this for you.
If you are running a prior version or a different OS, simply replace
the call to kdm, gdm or xdm with a call to autologin, or better yet, to
a script that calls autologin and falls back to [kgx]dm if autologin fails.


Is it safe?
===========
I think so. Read the source to make sure.


Patches etc
===========
Send patches, comments, suggestions, big CPUs, money etc to bero@redhat.com,
SPAM to /dev/null.
