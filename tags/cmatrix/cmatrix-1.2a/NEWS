03/31/2002 - Happy Easter!  After a long, long dormant period, CMatrix 
		has finally seen a new release.  The static limitations
		on size are now history, as the matrix size is allocated
		dynamically.  CMatrix can now also be resized on the
		fly. Also, the -f option has been reversed, it now turns
		the "linux" $TERM type on instead of off; most modern
		GNU/Linux systems don't seem to need this option anymore.
		There is now also a .spec file included for easy build.

04/09/2000 - CMatrix 1.1b includes support for the consolechars command
		as well as the older setfont.  Also included is better
		autoconf support and more helpful instruction in the
		Makefiles.

04/03/2000 - CMatrix 1.1a is released.  After a hiatus, interest in the
		project has seemed to swell, so I'm releasing a 
		(hopefully) improved and updated version of CMatrix.
		As with nano, CMatrix has a page at SourceForge.net
		to further facilitate development, as well as two mailing
		lists, cmatrix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net and
		cmatrix-devellists.sourceforge.net.  Anyone is welcome
		to join and participate in the further development
		of CMatrix, particularly people have contributed up until
		now in it's development =-)
