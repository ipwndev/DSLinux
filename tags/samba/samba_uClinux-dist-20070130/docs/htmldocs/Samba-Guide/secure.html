	Congratulations, your Samba networking skills are developing nicely. You started out
	with three simple networks in Chapter 2, and then in Chapter 3 you designed and built a
	network that provides a high degree of flexibility, integrity, and dependability. It
	was enough for the basic needs each was designed to fulfill. In this chapter you
	address a more complex set of needs. The solution you explore is designed 
	to introduce you to basic features that are specific to Samba-3.
	</p><p>
	You should note that a working and secure solution could be implemented using Samba-2.2.x. 
	In the exercises presented here, you are gradually using more Samba-3 specific features
	so caution is advised for anyone who tries to use Samba-2.2.x with the guidance here given. 
	To avoid confusion, this book is all about Samba-3. Let's get the exercises in this 
	chapter under way.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2538580"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>
	You have made Mr. Meany a very happy man. Recently he paid you a fat bonus for work 
	well done. It is one year since the last network upgrade. You have been quite busy. 
	Two months ago Mr. Meany gave approval to hire Christine Roberson who has taken over 
	general network management. Soon she will provide primary user support. You have demonstrated
	you can delegate responsibility, and plan and execute
	to that plan. Above all, you have shown Mr. Meany that you are a responsible person.
	Today is a big day. Mr. Meany called you to his office at 9 a.m. for news you never 
	expected. You are Mr. Bob Jordan and will take charge of business operations. Mr. Meany 
	is retiring and has entrusted the business to your capable hands. 
	</p><p>
	Mr. Meany may be retiring from this company, but not from work. He is taking the opportunity to develop
	Abmas Inc. into a larger and more substantial company. He says that it took him many
	years to wake up to the fact that there is no future in just running a business. He
	now realizes there is great personal reward and satisfaction in creation of career
	opportunities for people in the local community. He wants to do more for others as he is
	doing for you, Bob Jordan. Today he spent a lot of time talking about the grand plan.
	He has plans for growth that you will deal with in the chapters ahead.
	</p><p>
	Over the past year, the growth projections were exceeded. The network has grown to
	meet the needs of 130 users. Along with growth, the demand for improved services
	and better functionality has also developed. You are about to make an interim
	improvement and then hand over all Help desk and network maintenance to Christine.
	Christine has professional certifications in Microsoft Windows as well as in Linux;
	she is a hard worker and quite likable. Christine does not want to manage the department
	(although she manages well). She gains job satisfaction when left to sort things out.
	Occasionally she wants to work with you on a challenging problem. When you told her
	about your move, she almost resigned, although she was reassured that a new manager would
	be hired to run Information Technology and she would be responsible only for operations.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2538632"></a>Assignment Tasks</h3></div></div></div><p>
		You promised the staff Internet services including web browsing, electronic mail, virus
		protection, and a company Web site.  Christine is keen to help turn the vision into 
		reality. Let's see how close you can get to the promises made.
		</p><p>
		The network you are about to deliver will service 130 users today. Within 12 months,
		Abmas will aquire another company. Mr. Meany claims that within two years there will be
		well over 500 users on the network. You have bought into the big picture, so prepare 
		for growth.
		</p><p>
		You have purchased a new server, will implement a new network infrastructure, and 
		reward all staff with a new computer. Notebook computers will not be replaced at this time.
		</p><p>
		You have decided to not recycle old network components. The only items that will be
		carried forward are notebook computers. You offered staff new notebooks, but not 
		one person wanted the disruption for what was perceived as a marginal update. 
		You have made the decision to give everyone a new desktop computer, even to those 
		who have a notebook computer.
		</p><p>
		You have procured a DSL Internet connection that provides 1.5 Megabit/sec (bidirectional)
		and a 10 MBit/sec ethernet port. You have registered the domain
		<tt class="constant">abmas.us</tt>, and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) is supplying
		secondary DNS. Information furnished by your ISP is shown in <a href="secure.html#chap4netid" title="Table 4.1. Abmas.US ISP Information">???</a>.
		</p><p>
		It is of paramount priority that under no circumstances will Samba offer
		service access from an Internet connection. You are paying an ISP to
		give, as part of their value-added services, full firewall protection for your
		connection to the outside world. The only services allowed in from
		the Internet side are the following destination ports: <tt class="constant">http/https (ports 
		80 and 443), email (port 25), DNS (port 53)</tt>. All Internet traffic
		will be allowed out after network address translation (NAT). No internal IP addresses
		are permitted through the NAT filter as complete privacy of internal network
		operations must be assured.

		Christine has recommended that desktop systems should be installed from a single cloned
		master system that has a minimum of locally installed software and loads all software
		off a central application server. The benefit of having the central application server
		is that it allows single point maintenance of all business applications, something
		Christine is keen to pursue. She further recommended installation of anti-virus 
		software on workstations as well as on the Samba server. Christine is paranoid of
		potential virus infection and insists on a comprehensive approach to detective
		as well as corrective action to protect network operations.
		</p><p>
		A significant concern is the problem of managing company growth. Recently, a number 
		of users had to share a PC while waiting for new machines to arrive. This presented 
		some problems with desktop computers and software installation into the new users' 
		desktop profile.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2538897"></a>Dissection and Discussion</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Many of the conclusions you draw here are obvious. Some requirements are not very clear
	or may simply be your means of drawing the most out of Samba-3. Much can be done more simply
	than you will demonstrate here, but keep in mind that the network must scale to at least 500
	users. This means that some functionality will be over-designed for the current 130 user
	environment.

		In this exercise we are using a 24-bit subnet mask for the two local networks. This,
		of course, limits our network to a maximum of 253 usable IP addresses. The network
		address range chosen is one of the ranges assigned by RFC1918 for private networks.
		When the number of users on the network begins to approach the limit of usable
		addresses, it would be a good idea to switch to a network address specified in RFC1918
		in the 172.16.0.0/16 range. This is done in the following chapters.

		The high growth rates projected are a good reason to use the <tt class="constant">tdbsam</tt>
		passdb backend. The use of <tt class="constant">smbpasswd</tt> for the backend may result in
		performance problems. The <tt class="constant">tdbsam</tt> passdb backend offers features that
		are not available with the older flat ASCII-based <tt class="constant">smbpasswd</tt> database.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2538968"></a>
		The proposed network design uses a single server to act as an Internet services host for
		electronic mail, Web serving, remote administrative access vis SSH, as well as for 
		Samba-based file and print services. This design is often chosen by sites that feel 	
		they cannot afford or justify the cost or overhead of having separate servers. It must 
		be realized that if security of this type of server should ever be violated (compromised), 
		the whole network and all data is at risk. Many sites continue to choose this type 
		of solution; therefore, this chapter provides detailed coverage of key implementation 
		aspects.
		</p><p>
		Samba will be configured to specifically not operate on the ethernet interface that is
		directly connected to the Internet.

		You know that your ISP is providing full firewall services, but you cannot rely on that.
		Always assume that human error will occur, so be prepared by using Linux firewall facilities
		based on <span><b class="command">iptables</b></span> to effect Network Address Translation (NAT). Block all
		incoming traffic except to permitted well-known ports. You must also allow incoming packets
		to established outgoing connections. You will permit all internal outgoing requests.
		</p><p>
		The configuration of Web serving, Web proxy services, electronic mail, and the details of
		generic anti-virus handling are beyond the scope of this book and therefore are not
		covered, except insofar as this affects Samba-3.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539048"></a>
		Notebook computers are configured to use a network login when in the office and a
		local account to login while away from the office. Users store all work done in
		transit (away from the office) by using a local share for work files. Standard procedures
		will dictate that on completion of the work that necessitates mobile file access, all
		work files are moved back to secure storage on the office server. Staff is instructed
		to not carry on any company notebook computer any files that are not absolutely required.
		This is a preventative measure to protect client information as well as business private
		records.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539070"></a>
		All applications are served from the central server from a share called <tt class="constant">apps</tt>.
		Microsoft Office XP Professional and OpenOffice 1.1.0 will be installed using a network 
		(or administrative) installation. Accounting and financial management software can also
		be run only from the central application server. Notebook users are provided with
		locally installed applications on a need-to-have basis only.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2539093"></a>
		The introduction of roaming profiles support means that users can move between
		desktop computer systems without constraint while retaining full access to their data.
		The desktop travels with them as they move.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2539106"></a>
		The DNS server implementation must now address both internal needs as well as external
		needs. You forward DNS lookups to your ISP provided server as well as the 
		<tt class="constant">abmas.us</tt> external secondary DNS server.
		</p><p>

		Compared with the DHCP server configuration in <a href="small.html#dhcp01" title="Example 3.2. Abmas Accounting DHCP Server Configuration File  /etc/dhcpd.conf">???</a>, the configuration used
		in this example has to deal with the presence of an Internet connection. The scope set for it
		ensures that no DHCP services will be offered on the external connection. All printers are
		configured as DHCP clients, so that the DHCP server assigns the printer a fixed IP
		address by way of the ethernet interface (MAC) address. One additional feature of this DHCP
		server configuration file is the inclusion of parameters to allow dynamic DNS (DDNS) operation.
		</p><p>
		This is the first implementation that depends on a correctly functioning DNS server.
		Comprehensive steps are included to provide for a fully functioning DNS server that also
		is enabled for dynamic DNS operation. This means that DHCP clients can be auto-registered
		with the DNS server.
		</p><p>
		You are taking the opportunity to manually set the netbios name of the Samba server to
		a name other than what will be automatically resolved. You are doing this to ensure that
		the machine has the same NetBIOS name on both network segments.
		</p><p>
		As in the previous network configuration, printing in this network configuration uses
		direct raw printing (i.e., no smart printing and no print driver auto-download to Windows
		clients). Printer drivers are installed on the Windows client manually. This is not
		a problem given that Christine is to install and configure one single workstation and
		then clone that configuration, using Norton Ghost, to all workstations. Each machine is
		identical, so this should pose no problem.

		You would choose to add a safety margin of at least 50% to these estimates. The minimum 
		system memory recommended for initial startup would be 1 GByte, but to permit the system
		to scale to 500 users, it would make sense to provision the machine with 4 GBytes memory.
		An initial configuration with only 1 GByte memory would lead to early performance complaints
		as the system load builds up. Given the low cost of memory, it would not make sense to
		compromise in this area.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539256"></a>
		Aggregate Input/Output loads should be considered for sizing network configuration as 
		well as disk subsystems. For network bandwidth calculations, one would typically use an
		estimate of 0.1 MBytes/sec per user.  This would suggest that 100-Base-T (approx. 10 MBytes/sec)
		would deliver below acceptable capacity for the initial user load. It is, therefore, a good
		idea to begin with 1 Gigabit ethernet cards for the two internal networks, each attached
		to a 1 Gigabit Etherswitch that provides connectivity to an expandable array of 100-Base-T
		switched ports.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539277"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2539285"></a>
		Considering the choice of 1 Gigabit ethernet interfaces for the two local network segments,
		the aggregate network I/O capacity will be 2100 MBit/sec (about 230 MBytes/sec), an I/O
		demand that would require a fast disk storage I/O capability. Peak disk throughput is 
		limited by the disk sub-system chosen. It would be desirable to provide the maximum 
		I/O bandwidth that can be afforded. If a low-cost solution must be chosen, the use of 
		3Ware IDE RAID Controllers makes a good choice. These controllers can be fitted into a 
		64 bit, 66 MHz PCI-X slot. They appear to the operating system as a high speed SCSI 
		controller that can operate at the peak of the PCI-X bandwidth (approximately 450 MByte/sec).
		Alternative SCSI-based hardware RAID controllers should also be considered. Alternately,
		it would make sense to purchase well-known branded hardware that has appropriate performance
		specifications. As a minimum, one should attempt to provide a disk sub-system that can
		deliver I/O rates of at least 100 MBytes/sec.

		that is provided by CUPS libraries. This is achieved with the 
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2539659"></a>printing = CUPS as well as the
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2539667"></a>printcap name = CUPS entries.

		External interface scripts are provided to enable Samba to interface smoothly to
		essential operating system functions for user and group management. This is important
		to enable workstations to join the Domain, and is also important so that you can use
		the Windows NT4 Domain User Manager, as well as the Domain Server Manager. These tools
		are provided as part of the <tt class="filename">SRVTOOLS.EXE</tt> toolkit that can be 
		downloaded from the Microsoft FTP <a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SRVTOOLS.EXE" target="_top">site.</a>

		The <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file specifies that the Samba server will operate in (default) <i class="parameter"><tt>
			security = user</tt></i> mode<sup>[<a name="id2539748" href="#ftn.id2539748">5</a>]</sup> (User Mode).
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539765"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2539773"></a>
		Domain logon services as well as a Domain logon script are specified. The logon script
		will be used to add robustness to the overall network configuration.

		Roaming profiles are enabled through the specification of the parameter, <a class="indexterm" name="id2539815"></a>logon path = \\%L\profiles\%U. The value of this parameter translates the
		<tt class="constant">%L</tt> to the name by which the Samba server is called by the client (for this
		configuration, it translates to the name <tt class="constant">DIAMOND</tt>), and the <tt class="constant">%U</tt>
		will translate to the name of the user within the context of the connection made to the profile share.
		It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure there is a directory in the root of the
		profile share for each user. This directory must be owned by the user also. An exception to this
		requirement is when a profile is created for group use.

		Precautionary veto is effected for particular Windows file names that have been targeted by 
		virus-related activity. Additionally, Microsoft Office files are vetoed from opportunistic locking
		controls. This should help to prevent lock contention related file access problems.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539870"></a>
		Explicit controls are effected to restrict access to the <tt class="constant">IPC$</tt> share to

	The configuration of the server is the most complex so far. The following steps are used:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
		Basic System Configuration
		</p></li><li><p>
		Samba Configuration
		</p></li><li><p>
		DHCP and DNS Server Configuration

		</p></li><li><p>
		Application Share Configuration
		</p></li><li><p>
		Windows Client Configuration
		</p></li></ol></div><p>
	The following sections cover each step in logical and defined detail.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ch4bsc"></a>Basic System Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539968"></a>
	The preparation in this section assumes that your SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 8.0 system has been
	freshly installed. It prepares basic files so that the system is ready for comprehensive
	operation in line with the network diagram shown in <a href="secure.html#ch04net" title="Figure 4.1. Abmas Network Topology  130 Users">???</a>.
	</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2539995"></a>
		Using the UNIX/Linux system tools, name the server <tt class="constant">server.abmas.us</tt>.
		Verify that your hostname is correctly set by running:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> uname -n
server
</pre><p>
		An alternate method to verify the hostname is:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> hostname -f
server.abmas.us
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
	      <a class="indexterm" name="id2540040"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2540046"></a>
		Edit your <tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file to include the primary names and addresses
		of all network interfaces that are on the host server. This is necessary so that during
		startup the system can resolve all its own names to the IP address prior to
		startup of the DNS server. An example of entries that should be in the 
		<tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file is:
</p><pre class="screen">
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.1     sleeth1.abmas.biz sleeth1 diamond
192.168.2.1     sleeth2.abmas.biz sleeth2
123.45.67.66    server.abmas.us server
</pre><p>
		You should check the startup order of your system. If the CUPS print server is started before
		the DNS server (<span><b class="command">named</b></span>), you should also include an entry for the printers
		in the <tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file, as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
192.168.1.20    qmsa.abmas.biz qmsa
192.168.1.30    hplj6a.abmas.biz hplj6a
192.168.2.20    qmsf.abmas.biz qmsf
192.168.2.30    hplj6f.abmas.biz hplj6f
</pre><p>
	      <a class="indexterm" name="id2540104"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2540112"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2540120"></a>
		The printer entries are not necessary if <span><b class="command">named</b></span> is started prior to
	      startup of <span><b class="command">cupsd</b></span>, the CUPS daemon.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2540149"></a>
	      <a class="indexterm" name="id2540156"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2540162"></a>
		The host server is acting as a router between the two internal network segments as well
		as for all Internet access. This necessitates that IP forwarding must be enabled. This can be
		achieved by adding to the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/boot.local</tt> an entry as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>
		To ensure that your kernel is capable of IP forwarding during configuration, you may 
		wish to execute that command manually also. This setting permits the Linux system to 
		act as a router.<sup>[<a name="id2540192" href="#ftn.id2540192">6</a>]</sup>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2540204"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2540212"></a>
		Installation of a basic firewall and network address translation facility is necessary.
		The following script can be installed in the <tt class="filename">/usr/local/sbin</tt>
		directory. It is executed from the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/boot.local</tt> startup
		script. In your case, this script is called <tt class="filename">abmas-netfw.sh</tt>. The
		script contents are shown in <a href="secure.html#ch4natfw" title="Example 4.3. NAT Firewall Configuration Script">???</a>.

		There is one preparatory step without which you will not have a working Samba 
		network environment. You must add an account for each network user. 
                For each user who needs to be given a Windows Domain account, make an entry in the
                <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> file, as well as in the Samba password backend.
                Use the system tool of your choice to create the UNIX system account, and use the Samba
                <span><b class="command">smbpasswd</b></span> to create a Domain user account.
                There are a number of tools for user management under UNIX. Commonly known ones include:
                <span><b class="command">useradd, adduser</b></span>. In addition to these, there are a plethora of custom
                tools. You also want to create a home directory for each user.
		You can do this by executing the following steps for each user:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> useradd -m <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> passwd <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>
Changing password for <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>.
New password: XXXXXXXX
Re-enter new password: XXXXXXXX
Password changed
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbpasswd -a <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>
New SMB password: XXXXXXXX
Retype new SMB password: XXXXXXXX
Added user <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>.
</pre><p>
		You do of course use a valid user login ID in place of <i class="parameter"><tt>username</tt></i>.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2542120"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2542132"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2542143"></a>
                Using the preferred tool for your UNIX system, add each user to the UNIX groups created
                previously as necessary. File system access control will be based on UNIX group membership.
                </p></li><li><p>
                Create the directory mount point for the disk sub-system that can be mounted to provide
                data storage for company files. In this case the mount point indicated in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>
                file is <tt class="filename">/data</tt>. Format the file system as required, and mount the formatted
                file system partition using appropriate system tools.
                </p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2542187"></a>
                Create the top-level file storage directories for data and applications as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> mkdir -p /data/{accounts,finsvcs}
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> mkdir -p /apps
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R root.root /data
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R root.root /apps
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R bjordan.accounts /data/accounts
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R bjordan.finsvcs /data/finsvcs
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chmod -R ug+rwxs,o-rwx /data
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chmod -R ug+rwx,o+rx-w /apps
</pre><p>
                Each department is responsible for creating its own directory structure within the departmental
                share. The directory root of the <span><b class="command">accounts</b></span> share is <tt class="filename">/data/accounts</tt>.
                The directory root of the <span><b class="command">finsvcs</b></span> share is <tt class="filename">/data/finsvcs</tt>.
		The <tt class="filename">/apps</tt> directory is the root of the <tt class="constant">apps</tt> share
		that provides the application server infrastructure.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file specifies an infrastructure to support roaming profiles and network
		logon services. You can now create the file system infrastructure to provide the
		locations on disk that these services require. Adequate planning is essential
		since desktop profiles can grow to be quite large. For planning purposes, a minimum of
		200 Megabytes of storage should be allowed per user for profile storage. The following
		commands create the directory infrastructure needed:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> mkdir -p /var/spool/samba 
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/{netlogon/scripts,profiles}
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R root.root /var/spool/samba
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R root.root /var/lib/samba
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chmod a+rwxt /var/spool/samba
</pre><p>
		For each user account that is created on the system, the following commands should be
		executed:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> mkdir /var/lib/samba/profiles/'username'
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown 'username'.users /var/lib/samba/profiles/'username'
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chmod ug+wrx,o+rx,-w /var/lib/samba/profiles/'username'
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2542386"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2542393"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2542401"></a>
		Create a logon script. It is important that each line is correctly terminated with
		a carriage return and line-feed combination (i.e., DOS encoding). The following procedure
		works if the right tools (<tt class="constant">unix2dos</tt> and <tt class="constant">dos2unix</tt>) are installed.
		First, create a file called <tt class="filename">/var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts/logon.bat.unix</tt>
		with the following contents:
</p><pre class="screen">
net time \\diamond /set /yes
net use h: /home
net use p: \\diamond\apps
</pre><p>
		Convert the UNIX file to a DOS file using the <span><b class="command">unix2dos</b></span> as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> unix2dos &lt; /var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts/logon.bat.unix \
	&gt; /var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts/logon.bat

		This instructs the name resolver function (when configured correctly) to ask the DNS server

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2543382"></a>
	There are two essential steps to process startup configuration. First, the process
	must be configured so that it automatically restarts each time the server
	is rebooted. This step involves use of the <span><b class="command">chkconfig</b></span> tool that
	creates the appropriate symbolic links from the master daemon control file that is
	located in the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt> directory, to the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc'x'.d</tt>
	directories. Links are created so that when the system run-level is changed, the
	necessary start or kill script is run.
	</p><p>
	  <a class="indexterm" name="id2543417"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2543423"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2543431"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2543438"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2543446"></a>
	In the event that a service is not run as a daemon, but via the inter-networking
	super daemon (<span><b class="command">inetd</b></span> or <span><b class="command">xinetd</b></span>), then the <span><b class="command">chkconfig</b></span>
	tool makes the necessary entries in the <tt class="filename">/etc/xinetd.d</tt> directory
	and sends a hang-up (HUP) signal to the the super daemon, thus forcing it to
	re-read its control files.
	</p><p>
	Last, each service must be started to permit system validation to proceed.
	</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                Use the standard system tool to configure each service to restart
                automatically at every system reboot. For example:
                <a class="indexterm" name="id2543500"></a>
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chkconfig dhpc on
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chkconfig named on
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chkconfig cups on
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chkconfig smb on
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
                <a class="indexterm" name="id2543544"></a>

                <a class="indexterm" name="id2543558"></a>
		Now start each service to permit the system to be validated.
		Execute each of the following in the sequence shown:

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp restart
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> /etc/rc.d/init.d/named restart
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb restart
</pre><p>
                </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ch4valid"></a>Validation</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2543611"></a>
	Complex networking problems are most often caused by simple things that are poorly or incorrectly
	configured. The validation process adopted here should be followed carefully; it is the result of the
	experience gained from years of making and correcting the most common mistakes. Shortcuts often lead to basic errors. You should
	refrain from taking shortcuts, from making basic assumptions, and from not exercising due process
	and diligence in network validation. By thoroughly testing and validating every step in the process
	of network installation and configuration, you can save yourself from sleepless nights and restless
	days. A well debugged network is a foundation for happy network users and network administrators. 
	Later in this book you learn how to make users happier. For now, it is enough to learn to 
	validate. Let's get on with it.

			One of the most important facets of Samba configuration is to ensure that
			name resolution functions correctly. You can test name resolution
			with a few simple tests. The most basic name resolution is provided from the
			<tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file. To test its operation, make a
			temporary edit to the <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file. Using
			your favorite editor, change the entry for <tt class="constant">hosts</tt> to read:
</p><pre class="screen">
hosts:     files
</pre><p>
			When you have saved this file, execute the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">

			This proves that name resolution via the <tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file
			is working.
			</p></li><li><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543712"></a>
			So far, your installation is going particularly well. In this step we validate
			DNS server and name resolution operation. Using your favorite UNIX system editor,
			change the <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file so that the
			<tt class="constant">hosts</tt> entry reads:
</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543745"></a>
			Before you test DNS operation, it is a good idea to verify that the DNS server
			is running by executing the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> ps ax | grep named
  437 ?        S      0:00 /sbin/syslogd -a /var/lib/named/dev/log

			This means that we are ready to check DNS operation. Do so by executing:

</p><pre class="screen">

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.156/0.169/0.183/0.018 ms
</pre><p>
			You should take a few more steps to validate DNS server operation, as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> host -f diamond.abmas.biz
sleeth1.abmas.biz has address 192.168.1.1
</pre><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543814"></a>
			You may now remove the entry called <tt class="constant">diamond</tt> from the
			<tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt> file. It does not hurt to leave it there,
			but its removal reduces the number of administrative steps for this name.
			</p></li><li><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543840"></a>
			WINS is a great way to resolve NetBIOS names to their IP address. You can test
			the operation of WINS by starting <span><b class="command">nmbd</b></span> (manually, or by way
			of the Samba startup method shown in <a href="secure.html#procstart" title="Process Startup Configuration">???</a>). You must edit
			the <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file so that the <tt class="constant">hosts</tt>
			entry is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
hosts:        wins
</pre><p>
			The next step is to make certain that Samba is running using <span><b class="command">ps ax|grep mbd</b></span>, and then execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> ping diamond
PING diamond (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543901"></a>
			Now that you can relax with the knowledge that all three major forms of name
			resolution to IP address resolution are working, edit the <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>
			again. This time you add all three forms of name resolution to this file.
			Your edited entry for <tt class="constant">hosts</tt> should now look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
hosts:       files dns wins
</pre><p>
			The system is looking good. Let's move on.
			</p></li><li><p>
			It would give peace of mind to know that the DHCP server is running
			and available for service. You can validate DHCP services by running:

</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> ps ax | grep dhcp
 2618 ?        S      0:00 /usr/sbin/dhcpd ...
 8180 pts/2    S      0:00 grep dhcp
</pre><p>
			This shows that the server is running. The proof of whether or not it is working
			comes when you try to add the first DHCP client to the network.
			</p></li><li><p>
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2543961"></a>
			This is a good point at which to start validating Samba operation. You are 
			content that name resolution is working for basic TCP/IP needs. Let's move on.
			If your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file has bogus options or parameters, this may cause Samba
			to refuse to start. The first step should always be to validate the contents
			of this file by running:

			Verify that each printer has the IP address assigned in the DHCP server configuration file.
			The easiest way to do this is to ping the printer name. Immediately after the ping response
			has been received, execute <span><b class="command">arp -a</b></span> to find the MAC address of the printer
			that has responded. Now you can compare the IP address and the MAC address of the printer
			with the configuration information in the <tt class="filename">/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt> file. They
			should, of course, match. For example:
</p><pre class="screen">

			Your new server is connected to an Internet accessible connection. Before you start
			your firewall, you should run a port scanner against your system. You should repeat that
			after the firewall has been started. This helps you understand what extent the
			server may be vulnerable to external attack. One way you can do this is by using an
			external service provided such as the <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/scan" target="_top">DSL Reports</a> 
			tools. Alternately, if you can gain root-level access to a remote

	The use of an application server is a key mechanism by which desktop administration overheads
	can be reduced. Check the application manual for your software to identify how best to
	create an administrative installation.
	</p><p>
	Some Windows software will only run locally on the desktop computer. Such software
	is typically not suited for administrative installation. Administratively installed software
	permits one or more of the following installation choices:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		Install software fully onto a workstation, storing data files on the same workstation.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Install software fully onto a workstation with central network data file storage.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Install software to run off a central application server with data files stored
		on the local workstation. This is often called a minimum installation, or a
		network client installation.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Install software to run off a central application server with data files stored
		on a central network share. This type of installation often prevents storage
		of work files on the local workstation.
		</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2544545"></a>
	A common application deployed in this environment is an office suite.
	Enterprise editions of Microsoft Office XP Professional can be administratively installed
	by launching the installation from a command shell. The command that achieves this is:
	<span><b class="command">setup /a</b></span>. It results in a set of prompts through which various
	installation choices can be made. Refer to the Microsoft Office Resource SDK and Resource
	Kit for more information regarding this mode of installation of MS Office XP Professional.
	The full administrative installation of MS Office XP Professional requires approximately
	650 MB of disk space.
	</p><p>
	When the MS Office XP Professional product has been installed to the administrative network
	share, the product can be installed onto a workstation by executing the normal setup program.
	The installation process now provides a choice to either perform a minimum installation
	or a full local installation. A full local installation takes over 100 MB of disk space.
	A network workstation (minimum) installation requires typically 10-15 MB of
	local disk space. In the later case, when the applications are used, they load over the network.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2544583"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2544591"></a>
	Microsoft Office Service Packs can be unpacked to update an administrative share. This makes
	it possible to update MS Office XP Professional for all users from a single installation
	of the service pack and generally circumvents the need to run updates on each network
	Windows client.
	</p><p>
	The default location for MS Office XP Professional data files can be set through registry
	editing or by way of configuration options inside each Office XP Professional application.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2544614"></a>
	OpenOffice.Org OpenOffice Version 1.1.0 is capable of being installed locally. It can also
	be installed to run off a network share. The latter is a most desirable solution for office-bound 
	network users and for administrative staff alike. It permits quick and easy updates
	to be rolled out to all users with a minimum of disruption and with maximum flexibility.
	</p><p>
	The process for installation of administrative shared OpenOffice involves download of the
	distribution ZIP file, followed by extraction of the ZIP file into a temporary disk area.
	When fully extracted using the un-zipping tool of your choosing, change into the Windows
	installation files directory then execute <span><b class="command">setup -net</b></span>. You are
	prompted on screen for the target installation location. This is the administrative
	share point. The full administrative OpenOffice share takes approximately 150 MB of disk
	space.

	Christine needs to roll out 130 new desktop systems. There is no doubt that she also needs
	to reinstall many of the notebook computers that will be recycled for use with the new network

	a staged system for each type of target machine, and then use an image replication tool such as Norton
	Ghost (enterprise edition) to replicate the staged machine to its target desktops. The same can
	be done with notebook computers as long as they are identical or sufficiently similar.

		The tdb data structure and support system can handle more entries than the number of accounts
		that are possible on most UNIX systems. There is a practical limit that would come into play
		long before a performance boundary would be anticipated. That practical limit is controlled
		by the nature of Windows networking. There are few Windows file and print servers
		that can handle more than a few hundred concurrent client connections. The key limiting factors
		that predicate off-loading of services to additional servers are memory capacity, the number
		of CPUs, network bandwidth, and disk I/O limitations. All of these are readily exhausted by
		just a few hundred concurrent active users. Such bottlenecks can best be removed by segmentation
		of the network (distributing network load across multiple networks).
		</p><p>
		As the network grows, it becomes necessary to provide additional authentication servers (domain 
		controllers).  The tdbsam is limited to a single machine and cannot be reliably replicated. 
		This means that practical limits on network design dictate the point at which a distributed 
		passdb backend is required; at this time, there is no real alternative other than ldapsam (LDAP).
		</p><p>
		The guideline provided in <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG</em></span>, Chapter 10, Section 10.1.2, is to limit the number of accounts

		The default order by which Samba-3 attempts to communicate with MS Windows clients is via port 445 (the TCP port
		used by Windows clients when NetBIOS-less SMB over TCP/IP is in use). TCP port 139 is the primary port used for NetBIOS
		over TCP/IP. In this configuration Windows network operations are predicated around NetBIOS over TCP/IP. By
		specifying the use of port 139 before port 445, the intent is to reduce unsuccessful service connection attempts.
		The result of this is improved network performance. Where Samba-3 is installed as an Active Directory Domain
		member, the default behavior is highly beneficial and should not be changed.

		What is the difference between a print queue and a printer?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		A printer is a physical device that is connected either directly to the network or to a computer 
		via a serial, parallel, or USB connection so that print jobs can be submitted to it to create a 
		hard copy printout. Network attached printers that use TCP/IP-based printing generally accept a 
		single print data stream and block all secondary attempts to dispatch jobs concurrently to the 
		same device. If many clients were to concurrently print directly via TCP/IP to the same printer, 
		it would result in a huge amount of network traffic through continually failing connection attempts.
		</p><p>
		A print server (like CUPS or LPR/LPD) accepts multiple concurrent input streams or
		print requests. When the data stream has been fully received the input stream is closed,
		the job is then submitted to a sequential print queue where the job is stored until
		the printer is ready to receive the job.

		When DDNS records are updated directly from the DHCP server, it is possible for

		Why would you use WINS as well as DNS-based name resolution?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		WINS is to NetBIOS names as DNS is to fully qualified domain names (FQDN). The FQDN is
		a name like &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>myhost.mydomain.tld,</em></span></span>&#8221; where <i class="parameter"><tt>tld</tt></i>
		means <tt class="constant">top level domain</tt>. A FQDN is a long hand but easy to remember
		expression that may be up to 1024 characters in length and that represents an IP address. 
		A NetBIOS name is always 16 characters long. The 16<sup>th</sup> character
		is a name type indicator. A specific name type is registered<sup>[<a name="id2545578" href="#ftn.id2545578">9</a>]</sup> for each 
		type of service that is provided by the Windows server or client and that may be registered
		where a WINS server is in use.
		</p><p>
		WINS is a mechanism by which a client may locate the IP Address that corresponds to a
		NetBIOS name. The WINS server may be queried to obtain the IP Address for a NetBIOS name 
		that includes a particular registered NetBIOS name type. DNS does not provide a mechanism
		that permits handling of the NetBIOS name type information.
		</p><p>
		DNS provides a mechanism by which TCP/IP clients may locate the IP address of a particular 
		hostname or service name that has been registered in the DNS database for a particular domain. 
		A DNS server has limited scope of control and is said to be authoritative for the zone over
		which it has control.
		</p><p>
		Windows 200x Active Directory requires the registration in the DNS zone for the domain it 
		controls of service locator<sup>[<a name="id2545612" href="#ftn.id2545612">10</a>]</sup> records 
		that Windows clients and servers will use to locate Kerberos and LDAP services. ADS also 
		requires the registration of special records that are called global catalog (GC) entries 
		and site entries by which domain controllers and other essential ADS servers may be located.

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The use of an application server can significantly reduce application update maintenance.
		By providing a centralized application share, software updates need be applied to only
