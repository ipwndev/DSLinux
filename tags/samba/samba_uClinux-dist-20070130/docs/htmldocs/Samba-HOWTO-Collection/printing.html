Printing is often a mission-critical service for the users. Samba can
provide this service reliably and seamlessly for a client network
consisting of Windows workstations.
</p><p>
A Samba print service may be run on a Stand-alone or Domain Member server,
side by side with file serving functions, or on a dedicated print server.
It can be made as tight or as loosely secured as needs dictate. Configurations
may be simple or complex. Available authentication schemes are essentially
the same as described for file services in previous chapters. Overall,
Samba's printing support is now able to replace an NT or Windows 2000
print server full-square, with additional benefits in many cases. Clients
may download and install drivers and printers through their familiar
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span></span>&#8221; mechanism. Printer installations executed by
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Logon Scripts</em></span></span>&#8221; are no problem. Administrators can upload and
manage drivers to be used by clients through the familiar &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Add Printer
Wizard</em></span></span>&#8221;. As an additional benefit, driver and printer management may
be run from the command line or through scripts, making it more efficient
in case of large numbers of printers. If a central accounting of print jobs
(tracking every single page and supplying the raw data for all sorts of
statistical reports) is required, this function is best supported by
the newer Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)
as the print subsystem underneath the Samba hood.
</p><p>
This chapter deals with the foundations of Samba printing as they
are implemented by the more traditional UNIX (BSD- and System V-style)
printing systems. Many things covered in this chapter apply also to CUPS.
If you use CUPS, you may be tempted
to jump to the next chapter but you will certainly miss a few things if
you do. It is recommended that you read this chapter as well as <a href="CUPS-printing.html" title="Chapter 20. CUPS Printing Support">CUPS Printing Support</a>.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Most of the following examples have been verified on Windows XP
Professional clients. Where this document describes the responses to
commands given, bear in mind that Windows 200x/XP clients are quite
similar, but may differ in minor details. Windows NT is somewhat different
again.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2569768"></a>Technical Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>
Samba's printing support always relies on the installed print subsystem
of the UNIX OS it runs on. Samba is a &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>middleman.</em></span></span>&#8221; It takes
print files from Windows (or other SMB) clients and passes them to the real
printing system for further processing, therefore, it needs to communicate with
both sides: the Windows print clients and the UNIX printing system. Hence, we
must differentiate between the various client OS types, each of which behave
differently, as well as the various UNIX print subsystems, which themselves
have different features and are accessed differently.
</p><p>
This deals with the traditional way of UNIX printing. The next chapter
covers in great detail the more modern <span class="emphasis"><em>Common UNIX Printing
System</em></span> (CUPS).
</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>CUPS users, be warned: do not just jump on to the next
chapter. You might miss important information only found here!
</p></div><p>
It is apparent from postings on the Samba mailing list that print configuration
is one of the most problematic aspects of Samba administration today. Many
new Samba administrators have the impression that Samba performs some sort
of print processing. Rest assured, Samba does not perform any type of print
processing. It does not do any form of print filtering.
</p><p>
Samba obtains from its clients a data stream (print job) that it spools to a
local spool area. When the entire print job has been received, Samba invokes
a local UNIX/Linux print command and passes the spooled file to it. It is
up to the local system printing subsystems to correctly process the print
job and to submit it to the printer.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2569825"></a>Client to Samba Print Job Processing</h3></div></div></div><p>
Successful printing from a Windows client via a Samba print server to a UNIX
printer involves six (potentially seven) stages:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Windows opens a connection to the printer share.</p></li><li><p>Samba must authenticate the user.</p></li><li><p>Windows sends a copy of the print file over the network
into Samba's spooling area.</p></li><li><p>Windows closes the connection.</p></li><li><p>Samba invokes the print command to hand the file over
to the UNIX print subsystem's spooling area.</p></li><li><p>The UNIX print subsystem processes the print job.</p></li><li><p>The print file may need to be explicitly deleted
from the Samba spooling area. This item depends on your print spooler
configuration settings.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2569884"></a>Printing Related Configuration Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are a number of configuration parameters to control Samba's
printing behavior. Please refer to the man page for <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> for an
overview of these. As with other parameters, there are Global Level
(tagged with a <span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span> in the listings) and Service Level
(<span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>) parameters.
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Global Parameters</span></dt><dd><p> These <span class="emphasis"><em>may not</em></span> go into
		individual share definitions. If they go in by error,
		the <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> utility can discover this
		(if you run it) and tell you so.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Service Level Parameters</span></dt><dd><p> These may be specified in the
		<i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section of <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>.
		In this case they define the default behavior of all individual
		or service level shares (provided they do not have a different
		setting defined for the same parameter, thus overriding the
		global default).
		</p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2569964"></a>Simple Print Configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>
<a href="printing.html#simpleprc" title="Example 19.1. Simple configuration with BSD printing">Following example</a> shows a simple printing configuration.
If you compare this with your own, you may find 
additional parameters that have been pre-configured by your OS
vendor. Below is a discussion and explanation of the
parameters. This example does not use many parameters.
However, in many environments these are enough to provide a valid
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file that enables all clients to print.
</p><p>
</p><div class="example"><a name="simpleprc"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 19.1. Simple configuration with BSD printing</b></p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570016"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				printing = bsd</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570032"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				load printers = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570056"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				path = /var/spool/samba</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570072"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>

				public = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570103"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				writable = no</tt></i></td></tr></table></div><p>
This is only an example configuration. Samba assigns default values to
all configuration parameters. The defaults are conservative
and sensible. When a parameter is specified in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file, this
overwrites the default value. The <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> utility when
run as root is capable of reporting all setting, both default as well as
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file settings. <span><b class="command">Testparm</b></span> gives warnings for all
mis-configured settings. The complete output is easily 340 lines and more,
so you may want to pipe it through a pager program.
</p><p>
The syntax for the configuration file is easy to grasp. You should
know that  is not very picky about its syntax. As has been explained
elsewhere in this document, Samba tolerates some spelling errors (such
as <a class="indexterm" name="id2570158"></a>browseable instead of
<a class="indexterm" name="id2570166"></a>browseable), and spelling is
case-insensitive. It is permissible to use <i class="parameter"><tt>Yes/No</tt></i>
or <i class="parameter"><tt>True/False</tt></i> for Boolean settings. Lists of names
may be separated by commas, spaces or tabs.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2570188"></a>Verifying Configuration with <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span></h3></div></div></div><p>
To see all (or at least most) printing-related settings in Samba, including
the implicitly used ones, try the command outlined below. This command greps
for all occurrences of <tt class="constant">lp, print, spool, driver, ports</tt>
and <tt class="constant">[</tt> in testparms output. This provides a convenient
overview of the running <span><b class="command">smbd</b></span> print configuration. This
command does not show individually created printer shares or the spooling
paths they may use. Here is the output of my Samba setup, with settings
shown in <a href="printing.html#simpleprc" title="Example 19.1. Simple configuration with BSD printing">the example above</a>:

You can easily verify which settings were implicitly added by Samba's
default behavior. <span class="emphasis"><em>Remember: it may
be important in your future dealings with Samba.</em></span>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> testparm in Samba-3 behaves differently from that in 2.2.x: used

configuration used, add the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>-v</em></span></span>&#8221; parameter to testparm.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2570290"></a>Rapid Configuration Validation</h3></div></div></div><p>
Should you need to troubleshoot at any stage, please always come back
to this point first and verify if <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> shows the parameters you
expect. To give you a warning from personal experience,
try to just comment out the <a class="indexterm" name="id2570307"></a>load printers
parameter. If your 2.2.x system behaves like mine, you'll see this:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt>grep "load printers" /etc/samba/smb.conf
        #  load printers = Yes
        # This setting is commented out!!
 
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt>testparm -v /etc/samba/smb.conf | egrep "(load printers)"
        load printers = Yes
</pre><p>
I assumed that commenting out of this setting should prevent Samba from
publishing my printers, but it still did. It took some time to figure out
the reason. But I am no longer fooled ... at least not by this.
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>grep -A1 "load printers" /etc/samba/smb.conf</tt></b>
        load printers = No
        # The above setting is what I want!
        #  load printers = Yes
        # This setting is commented out!

<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>testparm -s -v smb.conf.simpleprinting | egrep "(load printers)"</tt></b>
        load printers = No

</pre><p>
Only when the parameter is explicitly set to
<a class="indexterm" name="id2570381"></a>load printers = No
would Samba conform with my intentions. So, my strong advice is:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Never rely on commented out parameters.</p></li><li><p>Always set parameters explicitly as you intend them to
behave.</p></li><li><p>Use <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> to uncover hidden
settings that might not reflect your intentions.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following is the most minimal configuration file:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>cat /etc/samba/smb.conf-minimal</tt></b>
        [printers]
</pre><p>
This example should show that you can use testparm to test any Samba
configuration file. Actually, we encourage you <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
to change your working system (unless you know exactly what you are
doing). Don't rely on the assumption that changes will only take effect after
you re-start smbd!  This is not the case. Samba re-reads it every 60 seconds
and on each new client connection. You might have to face changes for your
production clients that you didn't intend to apply. You will now
note a few more interesting things; <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> is useful to
identify what the Samba print configuration would be if you used this minimalistic
configuration. Here is what you can expect to find:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>testparm -v smb.conf-minimal | egrep "(print|lpq|spool|driver|ports|[)"</tt></b>

        max print jobs = 1000
        printable = No
        printing = bsd
        print command = lpr -r -P%p %s
        lpq command = lpq -P%p
        printer name =

</pre><p>
testparm issued two warnings:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We did not specify the <i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> section as printable.</p></li><li><p>We did not tell Samba which spool directory to use.</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, this was not fatal and Samba will default to values that will
work. Please, do not rely on this and do not use this example. This was
included to encourage you to be careful to design and specify your setup to do
precisely what you require. The outcome on your system may vary for some
parameters given, since Samba may have been built with  different compile-time
options. <span class="emphasis"><em>Warning:</em></span> do not put a comment sign
<span class="emphasis"><em>at the end</em></span> of a valid line. It will cause the parameter
to be ignored (just as if you had put the comment sign at the front). At first
I regarded this as a bug in my Samba versions. But the man page clearly says:
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Internal whitespace in a parameter value is retained verbatim.</em></span></span>&#8221;
This means that a line consisting of, for example:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td># This defines LPRng as the printing system</td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2570554"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				printing =  lprng</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
will regard the whole of the string after the
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em><tt class="constant">=</tt></em></span></span>&#8221; sign as the value you want to
define. This is an invalid value that will be ignored and a default
value will be

<a href="printing.html#extbsdpr" title="Example 19.2. Extended BSD Printing Configuration">Next configuration</a> shows a more verbose example configuration
for print-related settings in a BSD-style printing environment. What follows
is a discussion and explanation of the various parameters. We chose to
use BSD-style printing here because it is still the most commonly used
system on legacy UNIX/Linux installations. New installations predominantly
use CUPS, which is discussed in a separate chapter. The example explicitly
names many parameters that do not need to be specified because they are set
by default. You could use a much leaner <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. Alternately, you can use
<span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> or <span><b class="command">SWAT</b></span> to optimize the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>
file to remove all parameters that are set at default.

<i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i>
and <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>...). The
<i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> contains all parameters which apply
to the server as a whole. It is the place for parameters that have only a
global meaning. It may also contain service level parameters that then define
default settings for all other sections and shares. This way you can simplify
the configuration and avoid setting the same value repeatedly. (Within each
individual section or share you may, however, override these globally set
share settings and specify other values).

This is the second special section. If a section with this name appears in

share for every printer name it finds in the printcap file. You could regard
this section as a general convenience shortcut to share all printers with
minimal configuration. It is also a container for settings that should
apply as default to all printers. (For more details see the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>
man page.) Settings inside this container must be Share Level parameters.

if the share name has more than eight characters. Do not name a printer share with a name that may conflict
with an existing user or file share name. On Client connection requests, Samba always tries to find file

In each section defining a printer (or in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> section),
a <i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i> parameter may be defined. It sets a command to process the files
that have been placed into the Samba print spool directory for that printer. (That spool directory was,
if you remember, set up with the <a class="indexterm" name="id2572083"></a>path parameter). Typically,
this command will submit the spool file to the Samba host's print subsystem, using the suitable system
print command. But there is no requirement that this needs to be the case. For debugging or
some other reason, you may want to do something completely different than print the file. An example is a
command that just copies the print file to a temporary location for further investigation when you need
to debug printing. If you craft your own print commands (or even develop print command shell scripts),
make sure you pay attention to the need to remove the files from the Samba spool directory. Otherwise,
your hard disk may soon suffer from shortage of free space.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2572104"></a>Default UNIX System Printing Commands</h4></div></div></div><p>
You learned earlier on that Samba, in most cases, uses its built-in settings for many parameters
if it cannot find an explicitly stated one in its configuration file. The same is true for the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2572115"></a>print command. The default print command varies depending
on the <a class="indexterm" name="id2572123"></a>printing parameter setting. In the commands listed
below, you will notice some parameters of the form <span class="emphasis"><em>%X</em></span> where <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is
<span class="emphasis"><em>p, s, J</em></span>, and so on. These letters stand for printer name, spool-file and job ID, respectively.
They are explained in more detail further below. <a href="printing.html#printOptions" title="Table 19.1. Default Printing Settings">Next table</a> presents an overview of key

<i class="parameter"><tt>printing = CUPS</tt></i>, if Samba is compiled against libcups, it uses the CUPS API to submit
jobs. (It is a good idea also to set <a class="indexterm" name="id2572523"></a>printcap = cups
in case your <tt class="filename">cupsd.conf</tt> is set to write its auto-generated printcap file to an
unusual place). Otherwise, Samba maps to the System V printing commands with the -oraw option for printing,
i.e., it uses <span><b class="command">lp -c -d%p -oraw; rm %s</b></span>. With <i class="parameter"><tt>printing = cups</tt></i>,
and if Samba is compiled against libcups, any manually set print command will be ignored!
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2572556"></a>Custom Print Commands</h4></div></div></div><p>
After a print job has finished spooling to a service, the <a class="indexterm" name="id2572565"></a>print command
 will be used by Samba via a <span class="emphasis"><em>system()</em></span> call to process the
spool file. Usually the command specified will submit the spool file to the host's printing subsystem. But
there is no requirement at all that this must be the case. The print subsystem may not remove the spool
file on its own. So whatever command you specify, you should ensure that the spool file is deleted after
it has been processed.
</p><p>
There is no difficulty with using your own customized print commands with the traditional printing
systems. However, if you do not wish to roll your own, you should be well informed about the default
built-in commands that Samba uses for each printing subsystem (see
Table 17.1). In all the
commands listed in the last paragraphs, you see parameters of the form <span class="emphasis"><em>%X</em></span>. These are
<span class="emphasis"><em>macros</em></span>, or shortcuts, used as place-holders for the names of real objects. At the time
of running a command with such a placeholder, Samba will insert the appropriate value automatically. Print
commands can handle all Samba macro substitutions. In regard to printing, the following ones do have
special relevance:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%s, %f</tt></i>  the path to the spool file name.</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i>  the appropriate printer name.</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%J</tt></i>  the job name as transmitted by the client.</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%c</tt></i>  the number of printed pages of the spooled job (if known).</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%z</tt></i>  the size of the spooled print job (in bytes).</p></li></ul></div><p>
The print command must contain at least one occurrence of <i class="parameter"><tt>%s</tt></i> or
the <i class="parameter"><tt>%f</tt></i>. The <i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i> is optional. If no printer name is supplied,
the <i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i> will be silently removed from the print command. In this case, the job is
sent to the default printer.
</p><p>
If specified in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section, the print command given will be
used for any printable service that does not have its own print command specified. If there is neither a
specified print command for a printable service nor a global print command, spool files will be created
but not processed! Most importantly, print files will not be removed, so they will consume disk space.
</p><p>
Printing may fail on some UNIX systems when using the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>nobody</em></span></span>&#8221; account. If this happens, create an
alternative guest account and give it the privilege to print. Set up this guest account in the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section with the <i class="parameter"><tt>guest account</tt></i> parameter.
</p><p>
You can form quite complex print commands. You need to realize that print commands are just
passed to a UNIX shell. The shell is able to expand the included environment variables as
usual. (The syntax to include a UNIX environment variable <i class="parameter"><tt>$variable</tt></i>
in the Samba print command is <i class="parameter"><tt>%$variable</tt></i>.) To give you a working
<a class="indexterm" name="id2572756"></a>print command example, the following will log a print job
to <tt class="filename">/tmp/print.log</tt>, print the file, then remove it. The semicolon (&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>;</em></span></span>&#8221;
is the usual separator for commands in shell scripts:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2572783"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				print command = echo Printing %s &gt;&gt; /tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
You may have to vary your own command considerably from this example depending on how you normally print
files on your system. The default for the <a class="indexterm" name="id2572805"></a>print command
parameter varies depending on the setting of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2572813"></a>printing
parameter. Another example is:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id2572828"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>
					
				print command = /usr/local/samba/bin/myprintscript %p %s</tt></i></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2572848"></a>Printing Developments Since Samba-2.2</h2></div></div></div><p>
Prior to Samba-2.2.x, print server support for Windows clients was limited to <span class="emphasis"><em>LanMan</em></span>
printing calls. This is the same protocol level as Windows 9x/Me PCs offer when they share printers.
Beginning with the 2.2.0 release, Samba started to support the native Windows NT printing mechanisms. These
are implemented via <span class="emphasis"><em>MS-RPC</em></span> (RPC = <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote Procedure Calls</em></span>
). MS-RPCs use the <span class="emphasis"><em>SPOOLSS</em></span> named pipe for all printing.
</p><p>
The additional functionality provided by the new SPOOLSS support includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Support for downloading printer driver files to Windows 95/98/NT/2000 clients upon
	demand (<span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span>).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Uploading of printer drivers via the Windows NT <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Printer Wizard</em></span> (APW)
	or the <a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Imprints</a> tool set.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Support for the native MS-RPC printing calls such as
	StartDocPrinter, EnumJobs(), and so on.	(See the
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_top">MSDN documentation</a> for more information on the
	Win32 printing API).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Support for NT <span class="emphasis"><em>Access Control Lists</em></span> (ACL) on printer objects.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Improved support for printer queue manipulation through the use of internal databases for spooled
	job information (implemented by various <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
A benefit of updating is that Samba-3 is able to publish its printers to Active Directory (or LDAP).
</p><p>
A fundamental difference exists between MS Windows NT print servers and Samba operation. Windows NT
permits the installation of local printers that are not shared. This is an artifact of the fact that
any Windows NT machine (server or client) may be used by a user as a workstation. Samba will publish all
printers that are made available, either by default or by specific declaration via printer-specific shares.
</p><p>
Windows NT/200x/XP Professional clients do not have to use the standard SMB printer share; they can
print directly to any printer on another Windows NT host using MS-RPC. This, of course, assumes that
the client has the necessary privileges on the remote host that serves the printer resource. The
default permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the Print permissions to the well-known
<span class="emphasis"><em>Everyone</em></span> group. (The older clients of type Windows 9x/Me can only print to shared
printers).
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2572977"></a>Point'n'Print Client Drivers on Samba Servers</h3></div></div></div><p>
There is much confusion about what all this means. The question is often asked, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Is it or is
it not necessary for printer drivers to be installed on a Samba host in order to support printing from
Windows clients?</em></span></span>&#8221; The answer to this is no, it is not necessary.
</p><p>
Windows NT/2000 clients can, of course, also run their APW to install drivers <span class="emphasis"><em>locally</em></span>
(which then connect to a Samba-served print queue). This is the same method used by Windows 9x/Me
clients. (However, a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> existed in Samba 2.2.0 that made Windows NT/2000 clients
require that the Samba server possess a valid driver for the printer. This was fixed in Samba 2.2.1).
</p><p>
But it is a new capability to install the printer drivers into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share of the Samba server, and a big convenience, too. Then <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> clients
(including 95/98/ME) get the driver installed when they first connect to this printer share. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>uploading</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>depositing</em></span> of the driver into this
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share and the following binding of this driver to an existing
Samba printer share can be achieved by different means:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Running the <span class="emphasis"><em>APW</em></span> on an NT/200x/XP Professional client (this does not work from 95/98/ME clients).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Imprints</em></span> tool-set.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Using the <span class="emphasis"><em>smbclient</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>rpcclient</em></span> command-line tools.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Using <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsaddsmb</em></span> (only works for the CUPS
	printing system, not for LPR/LPD, LPRng, and so on).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
Samba does not use these uploaded drivers in any way to process spooled files. These drivers are utilized
entirely by the clients who download and install them via the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span></span>&#8221; mechanism
supported by Samba. The clients use these drivers to generate print files in the format the printer
(or the UNIX print system) requires. Print files received by Samba are handed over to the UNIX printing
system, which is responsible for all further processing, as needed.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2573104"></a>The Obsoleted [printer$] Section</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Versions of Samba prior to 2.2 made it possible to use a share named
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[printer$]</tt></i>. This name was taken from the same named service created by
	Windows 9x/Me clients when a printer was shared by them. Windows 9x/Me printer servers always
	have a <i class="parameter"><tt>[printer$]</tt></i> service that provides read-only access (with
	no password required) to support printer driver downloads. However, Samba's initial
	implementation allowed for a parameter named <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver location</tt></i> to
	be used on a per share basis. This specified the location of the driver files associated with
	that printer. Another parameter named <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver</tt></i> provided a means of
	defining the printer driver name to be sent to the client.
	</p><p>
	These parameters, including the <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver file</tt></i> parameter,
	are now removed and cannot be used in installations of Samba-3. The share name
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> is now used for the location of download-able printer
	drivers. It is taken from the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service created
	by Windows NT PCs when a printer is shared by them. Windows NT print servers always have a
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service that provides read-write access (in the context
	of its ACLs) to support printer driver downloads and uploads. This does not mean Windows
	9x/Me clients are now thrown aside. They can use Samba's <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
	share support just fine.
	</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2573191"></a>Creating the [print$] Share</h3></div></div></div><p>
In order to support the uploading and downloading of printer driver files, you must first configure a
file share named <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>. The public name of this share is hard coded
in the MS Windows clients. It cannot be renamed since Windows clients are programmed to search for a
service of exactly this name if they want to retrieve printer driver files.
</p><p>
You should modify the server's file to add the global parameters and create the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> file share (of course, some of the parameter values, such
as <a class="indexterm" name="id2573222"></a>path are arbitrary and should be replaced with appropriate values for your
site). See <a href="printing.html#prtdollar" title="Example 19.3. [print\$] example">next example</a>.

Of course, you also need to ensure that the directory named by the

</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2573424"></a>[print$] Section Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> is a special section in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>. It contains settings relevant to
potential printer driver download and is used by windows clients for local print driver installation.
The following parameters are frequently needed in this share section:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2573453"></a>comment = Printer Driver Download Area </span></dt><dd><p>
		The comment appears next to the share name if it is listed in a share list (usually Windows
		clients will not see it, but it will also appear up in a <span><b class="command">smbclient -L sambaserver
		</b></span> output).
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2573478"></a>path = /etc/samba/printers </span></dt><dd><p>

		<span class="guimenu">Connect network drive menu&gt;</span> from Windows Explorer.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2573540"></a>guest ok = yes </span></dt><dd><p>
		Gives read-only access to this share for all guest users. Access may be granted to
		download and install printer drivers on clients. The requirement for <i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok

		to have an account on the Samba host, then this is a non-issue.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> 
		If all your Windows NT users are guaranteed to be authenticated by the Samba server
		(for example, if Samba authenticates via an NT domain server and the user has already been
		validated by the Domain Controller in order to logon to the Windows NT session), then guest
		access is not necessary. Of course, in a workgroup environment where you just want
		to print without worrying about silly accounts and security, then configure the share for
		guest access. You should consider adding <a class="indexterm" name="id2573575"></a>map to guest = Bad	User in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section

In order for a Windows NT print server to support the downloading of driver files by multiple client
architectures, you must create several subdirectories within the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
service (i.e., the UNIX directory named by the <a class="indexterm" name="id2573687"></a>path
parameter). These correspond to each of the supported client architectures. Samba follows this model as
well. Just like the name of the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share itself, the subdirectories
must be exactly the names listed below (you may leave out the subdirectories of architectures you do
not need to support).
</p><p>
Therefore, create a directory tree below the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share for each architecture you wish
to support like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[print$]--+
          |--W32X86           # serves drivers to Windows NT x86
          |--WIN40            # serves drivers to Windows 95/98
          |--W32ALPHA         # serves drivers to Windows NT Alpha_AXP
          |--W32MIPS          # serves drivers to Windows NT R4000
          |--W32PPC           # serves drivers to Windows NT PowerPC
</pre><p>
</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Required permissions</h3><p>
	In order to add a new driver to your Samba host, one of two conditions must hold true:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		The account used to connect to the Samba host must have a UID of 0 (i.e., a root account).
		</p></li><li><p>
		The account used to connect to the Samba host must be named in the <span class="emphasis"><em>printer admin</em></span>list.
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Of course, the connected account must still have write access to add files to the subdirectories beneath
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>. Remember that all file shares are set to &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>read-only</em></span></span>&#8221; by default.
	</p></div><p>
Once you have created the required <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service and
associated subdirectories, go to a Windows NT 4.0/200x/XP client workstation. Open <span class="guiicon">Network
Neighborhood</span> or <span class="guiicon">My Network Places</span> and browse for the Samba host. Once you
have located the server, navigate to its <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder. You should see
an initial listing of printers that matches the printer shares defined on your Samba host.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2573812"></a>Installing Drivers into [print$]</h2></div></div></div><p>
Have you successfully created the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>, and have your forced Samba
to re-read its <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file? Good. But you are not yet ready to use the new facility. The client driver
files need to be installed into this share. So far it is still an empty share. Unfortunately, it is
not enough to just copy the driver files over. They need to be
correctly installed so that appropriate
records for each driver will exist in the Samba internal databases so it can provide the correct
drivers as they are requested from MS Windows clients. And that is a bit tricky, to say the least. We
now discuss two alternative ways to install the drivers into <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Using the Samba command-line utility <span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> with its various subcommands (here:
	<span><b class="command">adddriver</b></span> and <span><b class="command">setdriver</b></span>) from any UNIX workstation.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Running a GUI (<span class="guiicon">Printer Properties</span> and <span class="guiicon">Add Printer Wizard</span>)
	from any Windows NT/200x/XP client workstation.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
The latter option is probably the easier one (even if the process may seem a little bit weird at first).
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2573905"></a>Add Printer Wizard Driver Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>
The initial listing of printers in the Samba host's <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder accessed from a
client's Explorer will have no real printer driver assigned to them. By default this driver name is set
to a null string. This must be changed now. The local <span class="guiicon">Add Printer Wizard</span> (APW), run from
NT/2000/XP clients, will help us in this task.
</p><p>
Installation of a valid printer driver is not straightforward. You must attempt
to view the printer properties for the printer to which you want the driver assigned. Open the Windows
Explorer, open <span class="guiicon">Network Neighborhood</span>, browse to the Samba host, open Samba's <span class="guiicon">Printers</span>
folder, right-click on the printer icon and select <span class="guimenu">Properties...</span>. You are now trying to
view printer and driver properties for a queue that has this default <tt class="constant">NULL</tt> driver
assigned. This will result in the following error message:
</p><p><span class="errorname">
	Device settings cannot be displayed. The driver for the specified printer is not installed,
	only spooler properties will be displayed. Do you want to install the driver now?
	</span></p><p>
Do not click on <span class="guibutton">Yes</span>!  Instead, click on <span class="guibutton">No</span> in the error dialog.
Only now you will be presented with the printer properties window. From here, the way to assign a driver
to a printer is open to us. You now have the choice of:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Select a driver from the pop-up list of installed drivers. Initially this list will be empty.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Click on <span class="guibutton">New Driver</span> to install a new printer driver (which will
	start up the APW).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the APW is started, the procedure is exactly the same as the one you are familiar with in Windows (we
assume here that you are familiar with the printer driver installations procedure on Windows NT). Make sure
your connection is, in fact, setup as a user with <a class="indexterm" name="id2574017"></a>printer admin
privileges (if in doubt, use <span><b class="command">smbstatus</b></span> to check for this). If you wish to install
printer drivers for client operating systems other than <span class="application">Windows NT x86</span>,
you will need to use the <span class="guilabel">Sharing</span> tab of the printer properties dialog.
</p><p>
Assuming you have connected with an administrative (or root) account (as named by the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2574050"></a>printer admin parameter), you will also be able to modify
other printer properties such as ACLs and default device settings using this dialog. For the default
device settings, please consider the advice given further in <a href="printing.html#inst-rpc" title="Installing Print Drivers Using rpcclient">Installing Print Drivers Using <span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span></a>.

The second way to install printer drivers into <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> and set them
up in a valid way is to do it from the UNIX command line. This involves four distinct steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	Gather info about required driver files and collect the files.

We provide detailed hints for each of these steps in the paragraphs that follow.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2574171"></a>Identifying Driver Files</h4></div></div></div><p>
To find out about the driver files, you have two options. You could check the contents of the driver
CDROM that came with your printer. Study the <tt class="filename">*.inf</tt> files lcoated on the CDROM. This
may not be possible, since the <tt class="filename">*.inf</tt> file might be missing. Unfortunately, vendors have now started
to use their own installation programs. These installations packages are often in some Windows platform
archive format. Additionally, the files may be re-named during the installation process. This makes it
extremely difficult to identify the driver files required.
</p><p>
Then you only have the second option. Install the driver locally on a Windows client and
investigate which file names and paths it uses after they are installed. (You need to repeat
this procedure for every client platform you want to support. We show it here for the
<span class="application">W32X86</span> platform only, a name used by Microsoft for all Windows NT/200x/XP
clients.)
</p><p>
A good method to recognize the driver files is to print the test page from the driver's
<span class="guilabel">Properties</span> dialog (<span class="guilabel">General</span> tab). Then look at the list of
driver files named on the printout. You'll need to recognize what Windows (and Samba) are calling the
<span class="guilabel">Driver File</span>, <span class="guilabel">Data File</span>, <span class="guilabel">Config File</span>,
<span class="guilabel">Help File</span> and (optionally) the <span class="guilabel">Dependent Driver Files</span>
(this may vary slightly for Windows NT). You need to take a note of all file names for the next steps.
</p><p>
Another method to quickly test the driver filenames and related paths is provided by the
<span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> utility. Run it with <span><b class="command">enumdrivers</b></span> or with the
<span><b class="command">getdriver</b></span> subcommand, each at the <tt class="filename">3</tt> info level. In the following example,
<span class="emphasis"><em>TURBO_XP</em></span> is the name of the Windows PC (in this case it was a Windows XP Professional
laptop). I installed the driver locally to TURBO_XP, from a Samba server called <tt class="constant">KDE-BITSHOP</tt>.
We could run an interactive <span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> session; then we would get an
<span><b class="command">rpcclient /&gt;</b></span> prompt and would type the subcommands at this prompt. This is left as
a good exercise to the reader. For now, we use <span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> with the <tt class="option">-c</tt>
parameter to execute a single subcommand line and exit again. This is the method you would use if you
want to create scripts to automate the procedure for a large number of printers and drivers. Note the
different quotes used to overcome the different spaces in between words:

You may notice that this driver has quite a large number of <span class="guilabel">Dependent files</span>
(there are worse cases, however). Also, strangely, the
<span class="guilabel">Driver File</span> is tagged here
<span class="guilabel">Driver Path</span>. We do not yet have support for the so-called
<span class="application">WIN40</span> architecture installed. This name is used by Microsoft for the Windows
9x/Me platforms. If we want to support these, we need to install the Windows 9x/Me driver files in
addition to those for <span class="application">W32X86</span> (i.e., the Windows NT72000/XP clients) onto a
Windows PC. This PC can also host the Windows 9x/Me drivers, even if it runs on Windows NT, 2000 or XP.
</p><p>
Since the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share is usually accessible through the <span class="guiicon">Network
Neighborhood</span>, you can also use the UNC notation from Windows Explorer to poke at it. The Windows
9x/Me driver files will end up in subdirectory <tt class="filename">0</tt> of the <tt class="filename">WIN40</tt>
directory. The full path to access them will be <tt class="filename">\\WINDOWSHOST\print$\WIN40\0\</tt>.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
More recent drivers on Windows 2000 and Windows XP are installed into the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span></span>&#8221; subdirectory
instead of the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span></span>&#8221;. The version 2 of drivers, as used in Windows NT, were running in Kernel
Mode. Windows 2000 changed this. While it still can use the Kernel Mode drivers (if this is enabled by
the Admin), its native mode for printer drivers is User Mode execution. This requires drivers designed
for this. These types of drivers install into the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span></span>&#8221; subdirectory.

Now we need to collect all the driver files we identified in our previous step. Where do we get them
from? Well, why not retrieve them from the very PC and the same <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share that we investigated in our last step to identify the files? We can use <span><b class="command">smbclient</b></span>
to do this. We will use the paths and names that were leaked to us by <span><b class="command">getdriver</b></span>. The

After this command is complete, the files are in our current local directory. You probably have noticed
that this time we passed several commands to the <tt class="option">-c</tt> parameter, separated by semi-colons.
This effects that all commands are executed in sequence on the remote Windows server before smbclient
exits again.
</p><p>
Remember to repeat the procedure for the <span class="application">WIN40</span> architecture should
you need to support Windows 9x/Me/XP clients. Remember too, the files for these architectures are in the
<tt class="filename">WIN40/0/</tt> subdirectory. Once this is complete, we can run <span><b class="command">smbclient ...

We are now going to locate the driver files into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share. Remember, the UNIX path to this share has been defined
previously in your words missing here. You
also have created subdirectories for the different Windows client types you want to

Whew  that was a lot of typing! Most drivers are a lot smaller  many only having three generic
PostScript driver files plus one PPD. While we did retrieve the files from the <tt class="filename">2</tt>
subdirectory of the <tt class="filename">W32X86</tt> directory from the Windows box, we do not put them
(for now) in this same subdirectory of the Samba box. This relocation will automatically be done by the

Notice that there are already driver files present in the <tt class="filename">2</tt> subdirectory (probably
from a previous installation). Once the files for the new driver are there too, you are still a few
steps away from being able to use them on the clients. The only thing you could do now is to retrieve
them from a client just like you retrieve ordinary files from a file share, by opening print$ in Windows
Explorer. But that wouldn't install them per Point'n'Print. The reason
is: Samba does not yet know that
these files are something special, namely <span class="emphasis"><em>printer driver files</em></span> and it does not know
to which print queue(s) these driver files belong.

Next, you must tell Samba about the special category of the files you just uploaded into the

After this step, the driver should be recognized by Samba on the print server. You need to be very
careful when typing the command. Don't exchange the order of the fields. Some changes would lead to
an <tt class="computeroutput">NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</tt> error message. These become obvious. Other
changes might install the driver files successfully, but render the driver unworkable. So take care!
Hints about the syntax of the adddriver command are in the man page. The CUPS printing chapter

</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2575149"></a>Check Samba for Driver Recognition</h4></div></div></div><p>
Now the driver should be registered with Samba. We can easily verify this, and will do so in a
moment. However, this driver is not yet associated with a particular printer. We may check the driver
status of the files by at least three methods:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	From any Windows client browse Network Neighborhood, find the Samba host and open the Samba
	<span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder. Select any printer icon, right-click and select
	the printer <span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span>. Click the <span class="guilabel">Advanced</span>
	tab. Here is a field indicating the driver for that printer. A drop-down menu allows you to
	change that driver (be careful not to do this unwittingly). You can use this list to view
	all drivers known to Samba. Your new one should be among them. (Each type of client will only
	see his own architecture's list. If you do not have every driver installed for each platform,
	the list will differ if you look at it from Windows95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000/XP.)
	</p></li><li><p>
	From a Windows 200x/XP client (not Windows NT) browse <span class="guiicon">Network Neighborhood</span>,
	search for the Samba server and open the server's <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder,
	right-click on the white background (with no printer highlighted). Select <span class="guimenuitem">Server
	Properties</span>. On the <span class="guilabel">Drivers</span> tab you will see the new driver
	listed. This view enables you to also inspect the list of files belonging to that driver
	(this does not work on Windows NT, but only on Windows 2000 and Windows XP; Windows NT does not
	provide the <span class="guimenuitem">Drivers</span> tab). An
	alternative and much quicker method for
	Windows 2000/XP to start this dialog is by typing into a DOS box (you must of course adapt the
	name to your Samba server instead of <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i>):
	</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /s /t2 /n\\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i></tt></b></p></li><li><p>
	From a UNIX prompt, run this command (or a variant thereof) where
	<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i> is the name of the Samba host and xxxx represents the
	actual Samba password assigned to root:
	</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient -U'root%xxxx' -c 'enumdrivers' <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i></tt></b></p><p>
	You will see a listing of all drivers Samba knows about. Your new one should be among
	them. But it is only listed under the <i class="parameter"><tt>[Windows NT x86]</tt></i> heading, not under
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[Windows 4.0]</tt></i>, since you didn't install that part. Or did you?
	You will see a listing of all drivers Samba knows about. Your new one should be among them. In
	our example it is named <tt class="constant">dm9110</tt>. Note that the third column shows the other
	installed drivers twice, one time for each supported architecture. Our new driver only shows up
	for <span class="application">Windows NT 4.0 or 2000</span>. To have it present for <span class="application">Windows
	95, 98 and ME</span>, you'll have to repeat the whole procedure with the WIN40 architecture
	and subdirectory.

You will be able to bind that driver to any print queue (however, you are responsible that
you associate drivers to queues that make sense with respect to target printers). You cannot run the
<span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> <span><b class="command">adddriver</b></span> command repeatedly. Each run consumes the
files you had put into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share by moving them into the

each <span><b class="command">rpcclient ... adddriver</b></span> command.

Samba needs to know which printer owns which driver. Create a mapping of the driver to a printer, and
store this info in Samba's memory, the TDB files. The <span><b class="command">rpcclient setdriver</b></span> command
achieves exactly this:

The <span><b class="command">setdriver</b></span> command will only succeed if the

</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2575540"></a>Client Driver Installation Procedure</h2></div></div></div><p>
As Don Quixote said: &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>The proof of the pudding is in the eating.</em></span></span>&#8221; The proof
for our setup lies in the printing. So let's install the printer driver onto the client PCs. This is
not as straightforward as it may seem. Read on.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2575558"></a>First Client Driver Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>
Especially important is the installation onto the first client PC (for each architectural platform
separately). Once this is done correctly, all further clients are easy to setup and shouldn't need further
attention. What follows is a description for the recommended first procedure. You work now from a client
workstation. You should guarantee that your connection is not unwittingly mapped to <span class="emphasis"><em>bad
user</em></span> nobody. In a DOS box type:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>net use \\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-SERVER</tt></i>\print$ /user:root</tt></b></p><p>
Replace root, if needed, by another valid <a class="indexterm" name="id2575592"></a>printer admin user as given in
the definition. Should you already be connected as a different user, you will get an error message. There
is no easy way to get rid of that connection, because Windows does not seem to know a concept of logging
off from a share connection (do not confuse this with logging off from the local workstation; that is
a different matter).  On Windows NT/2K, you can force a logoff from all smb/cifs connections by restarting the 
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>workstation</em></span></span>&#8221; service. You can try to close all Windows file explorer and Internet Explorer for 
Windows. As a last resort, you may have to reboot. Make sure there is no automatic reconnection set up. It may be
easier to go to a different workstation and try from there. After you have made sure you are connected
as a printer admin user (you can check this with the <span><b class="command">smbstatus</b></span> command on Samba),
do this from the Windows workstation:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	Open <span class="guiicon">Network Neighborhood</span>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Browse to Samba server.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Open its <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Highlight and right-click on the printer.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Select <span class="guimenuitem">Connect</span> (for Windows NT4/200x
	it is possibly <span class="guimenuitem">Install</span>).
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
A new printer (named <i class="replaceable"><tt>printername</tt></i> on Samba-server) should now have
appeared in your <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> Printer folder (check <span class="guimenu">Start</span> --
<span class="guimenuitem">Settings</span> -- <span class="guimenuitem">Control Panel</span> -- <span class="guiicon">Printers
and Faxes</span>).
</p><p>
Most likely you are now tempted to try to print a test page. After all, you now can open the printer
properties, and on the <span class="guimenu">General</span> tab there is a button offering to do just that. But
chances are that you get an error message saying <span class="errorname">Unable to print Test Page</span>. The
reason might be that there is not yet a valid Device Mode set for the driver, or that the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Printer
Driver Data</em></span></span>&#8221; set is still incomplete.
</p><p>
You must make sure that a valid <i class="parameter"><tt>Device Mode</tt></i> is set for the
driver. We now explain what that means.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2575759"></a>Setting Device Modes on New Printers</h3></div></div></div><p>
For a printer to be truly usable by a Windows NT/200x/XP client, it must possess:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	A valid <span class="emphasis"><em>Device Mode</em></span> generated by the driver for the printer (defining things
	like paper size, orientation and duplex settings).
	</p></li><li><p>
	A complete set of <span class="emphasis"><em>Printer Driver Data</em></span> generated by the driver.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
If either of these is incomplete, the clients can produce less than optimal output at best. In the
worst cases, unreadable garbage or nothing at all comes from the printer or it produces a harvest of
error messages when attempting to print. Samba stores the named values and all printing related information in
its internal TDB database files <tt class="filename">(ntprinters.tdb</tt>, <tt class="filename">ntdrivers.tdb</tt>,
<tt class="filename">printing.tdb</tt> and <tt class="filename">ntforms.tdb</tt>).
</p><p>
What do these two words stand for? Basically, the Device Mode and the set of Printer Driver Data is a
collection of settings for all print queue properties, initialized in a sensible way. Device Modes and
Printer Driver Data should initially be set on the print server (the Samba host) to healthy
values so the clients can start to use them immediately. How do we set these initial healthy values?
This can be achieved by accessing the drivers remotely from an NT (or 200x/XP) client, as is discussed
in the following paragraphs.
</p><p>
Be aware that a valid Device Mode can only be initiated by a
<a class="indexterm" name="id2575849"></a>printer admin, or root
(the reason should be obvious). Device Modes can only be correctly
set by executing the printer driver program itself. Since Samba cannot execute this Win32 platform driver
code, it sets this field initially to NULL (which is not a valid setting for clients to use). Fortunately,
most drivers automatically generate the Printer Driver Data that is needed when they are uploaded to the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share with the help of the APW or rpcclient.
</p><p>
The generation and setting of a first valid Device Mode, however, requires some tickling from a client,
to set it on the Samba server. The easiest means of doing so is to simply change the page orientation on
the server's printer. This executes enough of the printer driver program on the client for the desired
effect to happen, and feeds back the new Device Mode to our Samba server. You can use the native Windows
NT/200x/XP printer properties page from a Window client for this:
</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	Browse the <span class="guiicon">Network Neighborhood.</span>
	</p></li><li><p>
	Find the Samba server.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Open the Samba server's <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Highlight the shared printer in question.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Right-click on the printer (you may already be here, if you followed the last section's description).
	</p></li><li><p>
	At the bottom of the context menu select <span class="guimenu">Properties</span> (if the menu still offers the 
	<span class="guimenuitem">Connect</span> entry further above, you
	need to click on that one first to achieve the driver
	installation as shown in the last section).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Go to the <span class="guilabel">Advanced</span> tab; click on <span class="guibutton">Printing Defaults</span>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Change the <span class="guimenuitem">Portrait</span> page setting to <span class="guimenuitem">Landscape</span> (and back).
	</p></li><li><p>
	Make sure to apply changes between swapping the page orientation to cause the change to actually take effect.
	</p></li><li><p>
	While you are at it, you may also want to set the desired printing defaults here, which then apply to all future
	client driver installations on the remaining from now on.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
This procedure has executed the printer driver program on the client platform and fed back the correct
Device Mode to Samba, which now stored it in its TDB files. Once the driver is installed on the client,
you can follow the analogous steps by accessing the <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> <span class="guiicon">Printers</span>
folder, too, if you are a Samba printer admin user. From now on, printing should work as expected.
</p><p>
Samba includes a service level parameter name <i class="parameter"><tt>default devmode</tt></i> for generating a default
Device Mode for a printer. Some drivers will function well with Samba's default set of properties. Others
may crash the client's spooler service. So use this parameter with caution. It is always better to have
the client generate a valid device mode for the printer and store it on the server for you.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2576048"></a>Additional Client Driver Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>
Every additional driver may be installed, along the lines described
above. Browse network, open the
<span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder on Samba server, right-click on <span class="guiicon">Printer</span> and choose
<span class="guimenuitem">Connect...</span>. Once this completes (should be not more than a few seconds,
but could also take a minute, depending on network conditions), you should find the new printer in your
client workstation local <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder.
</p><p>
You can also open your local <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder by
using this command on Windows 200x/XP Professional workstations:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 shell32.dll,SHHelpShortcuts_RunDLL PrintersFolder</tt></b></p><p>
or this command on Windows NT 4.0 workstations:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>
rundll32 shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL MAIN.CPL @2
</tt></b></p><p>
You can enter the commands either inside a <span class="guilabel">DOS box</span> window or in the <span class="guimenuitem">Run
command...</span> field from the <span class="guimenu">Start</span> menu.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2576141"></a>Always Make First Client Connection as root or &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>printer admin</em></span></span>&#8221;</h3></div></div></div><p>
After you installed the driver on the Samba server (in its <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share, you should always make sure that your first client installation completes correctly. Make it a
habit for yourself to build the very first connection from a client as <a class="indexterm" name="id2576163"></a>printer admin. This is to make sure that:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	A first valid <span class="emphasis"><em>Device Mode</em></span> is really initialized (see above for more
	explanation details).
	</p></li><li><p>	
	The default print settings of your printer for all further client installations are as you want them.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
Do this by changing the orientation to landscape, click on <span class="guiicon">Apply</span>, and then change it
back again. Next, modify the other settings (for example, you do not want the default media size set to
<span class="guiicon">Letter</span> when you are all using <span class="guiicon">A4</span>, right? You may want to set the
printer for <span class="guiicon">duplex</span> as the default, and so on).
</p><p>
To connect as root to a Samba printer, try this command from a Windows 200x/XP DOS box command prompt:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">C:\&gt; </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>runas /netonly /user:root "rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /p /t3 /n

</pre><p>
</p><p>
You will be prompted for root's Samba-password; type it, wait a few
seconds, click on <span class="guibutton">Printing
Defaults</span>, and proceed to set the job options that should be used as defaults by all
clients. Alternately, instead of root you can name one other member of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2576266"></a>printer admin from the setting.
</p><p>
	Now all the other users downloading and installing the driver the same way (called
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span></span>&#8221;) will have the same defaults set for them. If you miss this step
you'll get a lot of Help Desk calls from your users, but maybe you like to talk to people.

Your driver is installed. It is now ready for Point'n'Print
installation by the clients. You may have tried to download and use it
onto your first client machine, but
wait. Let's make sure you are acquainted first with a few tips and tricks you may find useful. For example,
suppose you did not set the defaults on the printer, as advised in the preceding
paragraphs. Your users complain about various issues (such as, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>We need to set the paper size
for each job from Letter to A4 and it will not store it.</em></span></span>&#8221;)
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2576313"></a>Setting Default Print Options for Client Drivers</h3></div></div></div><p>
The last sentence might be viewed with mixed feelings by some users and
Admins. They have struggled for hours and could not arrive at a point
where their settings seemed to be saved. It is not their fault. The confusing
thing is that in the multi-tabbed dialog that pops up when you right-click
on the printer name and select <span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span>, you
can arrive at two dialogs that appear identical, each claiming that they help
you to set printer options in three different ways. Here is the definite
answer to the Samba default driver setting FAQ:
</p><p><b>&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>I can not set and save default print options
for all users on Windows 200x/XP. Why not?</em></span></span>&#8221;. </b>
How are you doing it? I bet the wrong way. (It is not easy to find out, though). There are three different
ways to bring you to a dialog that seems to set everything. All three
dialogs look the same, but only one
of them does what you intend. You need to be Administrator or Print Administrator to do this for all
users. Here is how I reproduce it in an XP Professional:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><p>The first &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span></span>&#8221; way:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the printer (<span class="emphasis"><em>remoteprinter on cupshost</em></span>) and
		select in context menu <span class="guimenu">Printing Preferences...</span>.</p></li><li><p>Look at this dialog closely and remember what it looks like.</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>The second &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span></span>&#8221; way:
		</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="guimenu">Printers</span> folder.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the printer (<span class="emphasis"><em>remoteprinter on
			cupshost</em></span>) and select in the context menu
			<span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span></p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">General</span>
			tab.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="guibutton">Printing
			Preferences...</span> button.</p></li><li><p>A new dialog opens. Keep this dialog open and go back
			to the parent dialog.</p></li></ol></div><p>
	</p></li><li><p>
	The third and correct way: (should you do this from the beginning, just carry out steps 1
	and 2 from the second method above).
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">Advanced</span>
			tab. (If everything is &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>grayed out,</em></span></span>&#8221; then you are not logged
			in as a user with enough privileges).</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="guibutton">Printing
			Defaults</span> button.</p></li><li><p>On any of the two new tabs,
			click on the
			<span class="guilabel">Advanced</span> button.</p></li><li><p>A new dialog opens. Compare
			this one to the other. Are they
			identical looking comparing one from
			&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>B.5</em></span></span>&#8221; and one from A.3".</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div><p>
Do you see any difference in the two settings dialogs? I do not either. However, only the last one, which
you arrived at with steps C.1 through 6 will permanently save any settings which will then become the defaults
for new users. If you want all clients to have the same defaults, you need to conduct these steps as
administrator (<a class="indexterm" name="id2576562"></a>printer admin in ) before
a client downloads the driver (the clients can later set their own per-user defaults
by following procedures A or B above). Windows 200x/XP allow per-user default settings and the ones the
administrator gives them, before they set up their own. The parents of the identically-looking dialogs have a slight difference in their window names; one is called <tt class="computeroutput">Default Print
Values for Printer Foo on Server Bar"</tt> (which is the one you need) and the other is called
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em><tt class="computeroutput">Print Settings for Printer Foo on Server Bar</tt></em></span></span>&#8221;. The last one is the one you
arrive at when you right-click on the printer and select <span class="guimenuitem">Print Settings...</span>. This
is the one that you were taught to use back in the days of Windows NT, so it is only natural to try the
same way with Windows 200x/XP. You would not dream that there is now a different path to arrive at an
identically looking, but functionally different, dialog to set defaults for all users.

One issue that has arisen during the recent development phase of Samba is the need to support driver
downloads for hundreds of printers. Using Windows NT APW here is somewhat awkward (to say the least). If
you do not want to acquire RSS pains from the printer installation clicking orgy alone, you need
to think about a non-interactive script.
</p><p>
If more than one printer is using the same driver, the <span><b class="command">rpcclient setdriver</b></span>
command can be used to set the driver associated with an installed queue. If the driver is uploaded to
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> once and registered with the printing TDBs, it can be used by
multiple print queues. In this case, you just need to repeat the <span><b class="command">setprinter</b></span> subcommand of
<span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> for every queue (without the need to conduct the <span><b class="command">adddriver</b></span>
repeatedly). The following is an example of how this could be accomplished:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i> -U root%<i class="replaceable"><tt>secret</tt></i> -c 'enumdrivers'</tt></b>

It may not be easy to recognize that the first call to <span><b class="command">enumprinters</b></span> showed the
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>dm9110</em></span></span>&#8221; printer with an empty string where the driver should have been listed (between
the 2 commas in the description field). After the <span><b class="command">setdriver</b></span> command
succeeded, all is well.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2576934"></a>Adding New Printers with the Windows NT APW</h3></div></div></div><p>
By default, Samba exhibits all printer shares defined in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> in the <span class="guiicon">Printers</span>
folder. Also located in this folder is the Windows NT Add Printer Wizard icon. The APW will be shown only if:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	The connected user is able to successfully execute an <span><b class="command">OpenPrinterEx(\\server)</b></span> with
	administrative privileges (i.e., root or <a class="indexterm" name="id2576971"></a>printer admin).
	</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p> Try this from a Windows 200x/XP DOS box command prompt:
	</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>
	runas /netonly /user:root rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /p /t0 /n \\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-SERVER</tt></i>\<i class="replaceable"><tt>printersharename</tt></i>
	</tt></b></p><p>
	Click on <span class="guibutton">Printing Preferences</span>.
	</p></div></li><li><p>... contains the setting
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2577013"></a>show add printer wizard = yes (the
	default).</p></li></ul></div><p>
The APW can do various things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Upload a new driver to the Samba <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Associate an uploaded driver with an existing (but still driverless) print queue.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Exchange the currently used driver for an existing print queue with one that has been uploaded before.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Add an entirely new printer to the Samba host (only in conjunction with a working
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2577057"></a>add printer command. A corresponding
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2577065"></a>delete printer command for removing entries from the
	<span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder may also be provided).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
The last one (add a new printer) requires more effort than the previous ones. To use
the APW to successfully add a printer to a Samba server, the <a class="indexterm" name="id2577086"></a>add printer command must have a defined value. The program hook must successfully
add the printer to the UNIX print system (i.e., to <tt class="filename">/etc/printcap</tt>,
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/printers.conf</tt> or other appropriate files) and to <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> if necessary.
</p><p>
When using the APW from a client, if the named printer share does not exist, smbd will execute the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2577120"></a>add printer command and re-parse to the to attempt to locate the new printer
share. If the share is still not defined, an error of <span class="errorname">Access Denied</span> is returned to
the client. The <a class="indexterm" name="id2577133"></a>add printer command is executed
under the context of the connected user, not necessarily a root account. A <a class="indexterm" name="id2577142"></a>map to guest = bad user may have connected you unwittingly under the wrong
privilege. You should check it by using the <span><b class="command">smbstatus</b></span> command.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577159"></a>Error Message: &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="errorname">Cannot connect under a different Name</span></em></span></span>&#8221;</h3></div></div></div><p>
Once you are connected with the wrong credentials, there is no means to reverse the situation other than
to close all Explorer Windows, and perhaps reboot.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	The <span><b class="command">net use \\SAMBA-SERVER\sharename /user:root</b></span> gives you an error message:
	&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Multiple connections to a server or a shared resource by the same user utilizing
	the several user names are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server,
	esp. the shared resource, and try again.</em></span></span>&#8221;
	</p></li><li><p>
	Every attempt to &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>connect a network drive</em></span></span>&#8221; to <tt class="filename">\\SAMBASERVER\\print$</tt>
	to <tt class="constant">z:</tt> is countered by the pertinacious message: &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>This
	network folder is currently connected under different credentials (username and password).
	Disconnect first any existing connection to this network share in order to connect again under
	a different username and password</em></span></span>&#8221;.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
So you close all connections. You try again. You get the same message. You check from the Samba side,
using <span><b class="command">smbstatus</b></span>. Yes, there are more connections. You kill them all. The client
still gives you the same error message. You watch the smbd.log file on a high debug level and try
reconnect. Same error message, but not a single line in the log. You start to wonder if there was a
connection attempt at all. You run ethereal and tcpdump while you try to connect. Result: not a single
byte goes on the wire. Windows still gives the error message. You close all Explorer windows and start it
again. You try to connect  and this times it works!  Windows seems to cache connection information somewhere and
does not keep it up-to-date (if you are unlucky you might need to reboot to get rid of the error message).
</p><p>
The easiest way to forcefully terminate all connections from your client to a server is by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">C:\&gt; </tt> net use * /delete
</pre><p>
This will disconnect all mapped drives also and will allow you create fresh connection as required.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577272"></a>Take Care When Assembling Driver Files</h3></div></div></div><p>
You need to be extremely careful when you take notes about the files and belonging to a particular
driver. Don't confuse the files for driver version &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span></span>&#8221; (for Windows 9x/Me, going into
<tt class="filename">[print$]/WIN/0/</tt>), driver version <tt class="filename">2</tt> (Kernel Mode driver for Windows NT,
going into <tt class="filename">[print$]/W32X86/2/</tt> may be used on Windows 200x/XP also), and
driver version &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span></span>&#8221; (non-Kernel Mode driver going into <tt class="filename">[print$]/W32X86/3/</tt>
cannot be used on Windows NT). Quite often these different driver versions contain
files that have the same name but actually are very different. If you look at them from
the Windows Explorer (they reside in <tt class="filename">%WINDOWS%\system32\spool\drivers\W32X86\</tt>),
you will probably see names in capital letters, while an <span><b class="command">enumdrivers</b></span> command from Samba
would show mixed or lower case letters. So it is easy to confuse them. If you install them manually using
<span><b class="command">rpcclient</b></span> and subcommands, you may even succeed without an error message. Only later,
when you try install on a client, you will encounter error messages like <tt class="computeroutput">This server
has no appropriate driver for the printer</tt>.
</p><p>
Here is an example. You are invited to look closely at the various files, compare their names and
their spelling, and discover the differences in the composition of the version 2 and 3 sets. Note: the
version 0 set contained 40 <i class="parameter"><tt>Dependentfiles</tt></i>, so I left it out for space reasons:

In my example were even more differences than shown here. Conclusion: you must be careful to select
the correct driver files for each driver version. Don't rely on the
names alone and don't interchange files
belonging to different driver versions.

Windows NT/2000 print servers associate a port with each printer. These normally take the form of
<tt class="filename">LPT1:</tt>, <tt class="filename">COM1:</tt>,
<tt class="filename">FILE:</tt>, and so on. Samba must also
support the concept of ports associated with a printer. By default, only one printer port, named &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Samba
Printer Port</em></span></span>&#8221;, exists on a system. Samba does not really need such a &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>port</em></span></span>&#8221; in order
to print; rather it is a requirement of Windows clients. They insist on being told about an available
port when they request this information, otherwise they throw an error message at you. So Samba fakes the port
information to keep the Windows clients happy.
</p><p>
Samba does not support the concept of <tt class="constant">Printer Pooling</tt> internally either. Printer
Pooling assigns a logical printer to multiple ports as a form of load balancing or fail over.
</p><p>
If you require multiple ports be defined for some reason or another (my users and my boss should not know
that they are working with Samba), configure <a class="indexterm" name="id2577597"></a>enumports command
which can be used to define an external program that generates a listing of ports on a system.

So now the printing works, but there are still problems. Most jobs print well, some do not print at
all. Some jobs have problems with fonts, which do not look good. Some jobs print fast and some
are dead-slow. We cannot cover it all, but we want to encourage you to read the brief paragraph about
&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Avoiding the Wrong PostScript Driver Settings</em></span></span>&#8221; in the CUPS Printing part of this document.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2577631"></a>The Imprints Tool-set</h2></div></div></div><p>
The Imprints tool set provides a UNIX equivalent of the Windows NT Add Printer
Wizard. For complete information, please refer to the 
<a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Imprints</a> Web site as well as the documentation
included with the imprints source distribution. This section only provides a brief introduction to
the features of Imprints.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the Imprints tool-set is no longer maintained. As of December 2000, the project is in
need of a new maintainer. The most important skill to have is Perl coding and an interest in MS-RPC-based
printing used in Samba. If you wish to volunteer, please coordinate
your efforts on the Samba technical
mailing list. The tool-set is still in usable form, but only for a series of older printer models where
there are prepared packages to use. Packages for more up-to-date print devices are needed if Imprints
should have a future.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577664"></a>What is Imprints?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Imprints is a collection of tools for supporting these goals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Providing a central repository of information regarding Windows NT and 95/98 printer driver packages.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Providing the tools necessary for creating the Imprints printer driver packages.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Providing an installation client that will obtain printer drivers from a central Internet (or intranet) Imprints Server
	repository and install them on remote Samba and Windows NT4 print servers.
	</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577698"></a>Creating Printer Driver Packages</h3></div></div></div><p>
The process of creating printer driver packages is beyond the scope of this document (refer to Imprints.txt
also included with the Samba distribution for more information). In short, an Imprints driver package
is a gzipped tarball containing the driver files, related INF files, and a control file needed by the
installation client.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577714"></a>The Imprints Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Imprints server is really a database server that may be queried via standard HTTP mechanisms. Each
printer entry in the database has an associated URL for the actual downloading of the package. Each
package is digitally signed via GnuPG which can be used to verify that
the package downloaded is actually
the one referred in the Imprints database. It is strongly recommended that this security check
not be disabled.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2577731"></a>The Installation Client</h3></div></div></div><p>
More information regarding the Imprints installation client is available from the the documentation file
<tt class="filename">Imprints-Client-HOWTO.ps</tt> that is included with the Imprints source package. The Imprints
installation client comes in two forms:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A set of command line Perl scripts.</p></li><li><p>A GTK+ based graphical interface to the command line Perl scripts.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The installation client (in both forms) provides a means of querying the Imprints database server for
a matching list of known printer model names as well as a means to download and install the drivers on
remote Samba and Windows NT print servers.
</p><p>
The basic installation process is in four steps and Perl code is wrapped around smbclient and rpcclient.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	For each supported architecture for a given driver:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>rpcclient: Get the appropriate upload directory on the remote server.</p></li><li><p>smbclient: Upload the driver files.</p></li><li><p>rpcclient: Issues an AddPrinterDriver() MS-RPC.</p></li></ol></div><p>
	</p></li><li><p>rpcclient: Issue an AddPrinterEx() MS-RPC to actually create the printer.</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of the problems encountered when implementing the Imprints tool set was the name space issues between
various supported client architectures. For example, Windows NT includes a driver named &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Apple LaserWriter
II NTX v51.8</em></span></span>&#8221; and Windows 95 calls its version of this driver &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Apple LaserWriter II NTX</em></span></span>&#8221;.
</p><p>
The problem is how to know what client drivers have been uploaded for a printer. An astute reader will
remember that the Windows NT Printer Properties dialog only includes space for one printer driver name. A
quick look in the Windows NT 4.0 system registry at:
</p><p><tt class="filename">
 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environment
</tt></p><p>
will reveal that Windows NT always uses the NT driver name. This is okay as Windows NT always requires
that at least the Windows NT version of the printer driver is present. Samba does not have the
requirement internally, therefore, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>How can you use the NT driver name if it has not already been installed?</em></span></span>&#8221;
</p><p>
The way of sidestepping this limitation is to require that all Imprints printer driver packages include both the Intel Windows NT and
95/98 printer drivers and that the NT driver is installed first.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2577868"></a>Adding Network Printers without User Interaction</h2></div></div></div><p>
The following MS Knowledge Base article may be of some help if you need to handle Windows 2000
clients: <span class="emphasis"><em>How to Add Printers with No User Interaction in Windows 2000,</em></span> (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;189105" target="_top">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;189105</a>).
It also applies to Windows XP Professional clients.
The ideas sketched out in this section are inspired by this article, which describes a command-line method that can be
applied to install network and local printers and their drivers. This is most useful if integrated in Logon
Scripts. You can see what options are available by typing in the command prompt (<span><b class="command">DOS box</b></span>):
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /?</tt></b></p><p>
A window pops up that shows you all of the command-line switches available. An extensive list of examples
is also provided. This is only for Win 200x/XP, it does not work on
Windows NT. Windows NT probably has
some other tools in the respective Resource Kit. Here is a suggestion about what a client logon script
might contain, with a short explanation of what the lines actually do (it works if 200x/XP Windows
clients access printers via Samba, and works for Windows-based print servers too):
</p><pre class="screen">
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /dn /n "\\cupsserver\infotec2105-IPDS" /q</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /in /n "\\cupsserver\infotec2105-PS"</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /y /n "\\cupsserver\infotec2105-PS"</tt></b>
</pre><p>
Here is a list of the used command-line parameters: 
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">/dn</span></dt><dd><p>deletes a network printer</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/q</span></dt><dd><p>quiet modus</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/n</span></dt><dd><p>names a printer</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/in</span></dt><dd><p>adds a network printer connection</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/y</span></dt><dd><p>sets printer as default printer</p></dd></dl></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	Line 1 deletes a possibly existing previous network printer <span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-IPDS</em></span>
	(which had used native Windows drivers with LPRng that were removed from the server that was
	converted to CUPS). The <span><b class="command">/q</b></span> at the end eliminates Confirm
	or error dialog boxes from popping up. They should not be presented to the user logging on.
	</p></li><li><p>	
	Line 2 adds the new printer
	<span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-PS</em></span> (which actually is the same
	physical device but is now run by the new CUPS printing system and associated with the
	CUPS/Adobe PS drivers). The printer and its driver must have been added to Samba prior to
	the user logging in (e.g., by a procedure as discussed earlier in this chapter, or by running
	<span><b class="command">cupsaddsmb</b></span>). The driver is now auto-downloaded to the client PC where the
	user is about to log in.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Line 3 sets the default printer to this new network printer (there might be several other
	printers installed with this same method and some may be local as well, so we decide for a
	default printer). The default printer selection may, of course, be different for different users.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
The second line only works if the printer <span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-PS</em></span> has an already working
print queue on the <tt class="constant">cupsserver</tt>, and if the
printer drivers have been successfully uploaded
(via the <span><b class="command">APW</b></span>, <span><b class="command">smbclient/rpcclient</b></span>, or <span><b class="command">cupsaddsmb</b></span>)
into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> driver repository of Samba. Some Samba versions
prior to version 3.0 required a re-start of smbd after the printer install and the driver upload,
otherwise the script (or any other client driver download) would fail.
</p><p>
Since there no easy way to test for the existence of an installed network printer from the logon script,
do not bother checking, just allow the de-installation/re-installation to occur every time a user logs in;
it's really quick anyway (1 to 2 seconds).
</p><p>
The additional benefits for this are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	It puts in place any printer default setup changes automatically at every user logon.
	</p></li><li><p>
	It allows for &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>roaming</em></span></span>&#8221; users' login into the domain from different workstations.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
Since network printers are installed per user, this much simplifies the process of keeping the installation
up-to-date. The few extra seconds at logon time will not really be noticeable. Printers can be centrally
added, changed and deleted at will on the server with no user intervention required from the clients
(you just need to keep the logon scripts up-to-date).
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2578141"></a>The <span><b class="command">addprinter</b></span> Command</h2></div></div></div><p>
The <span><b class="command">addprinter</b></span> command can be configured to be a shell script or program executed by
Samba. It is triggered by running the APW from a client against the Samba print server. The APW asks
the user to fill in several fields (such as printer name, driver to be used, comment, port monitor,
and so on). These parameters are passed on to Samba by the APW. If the addprinter command is designed in a
way that it can create a new printer (through writing correct printcap entries on legacy systems, or
execute the <span><b class="command">lpadmin</b></span> command on more modern systems) and create the associated share
in, then the APW will in effect really create a new printer on Samba and the UNIX print subsystem!
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2578180"></a>Migration of Classical Printing to Samba</h2></div></div></div><p>
The basic NT-style printer driver management has not changed considerably in 3.0 over the 2.2.x releases
(apart from many small improvements). Here migration should be quite easy, especially if you followed
previous advice to stop using deprecated parameters in your setup. For migrations from an existing 2.0.x
setup, or if you continued Windows 9x/Me-style printing in your Samba 2.2 installations, it is more of
an effort. Please read the appropriate release notes and the HOWTO Collection for Samba-2.2.x. You can
follow several paths. Here are possible scenarios for migration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	You need to study and apply the new Windows NT printer and driver support. Previously used
	parameters <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver file</tt></i>, <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver</tt></i>
	and <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver location</tt></i> are no longer supported.
	</p></li><li><p>
	If you want to take advantage of Windows NT printer driver support, you also need to migrate the
	Windows 9x/Me drivers to the new setup.
	</p></li><li><p>
	An existing <tt class="filename">printers.def</tt> file (the one specified in the now removed parameter
	<i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver file</tt></i>) will no longer work with Samba-3. In 3.0, smbd attempts
	to locate a Windows 9x/Me driver files for the printer in <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
	and additional settings in the TDB and only there; if it fails, it will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
	(as 2.2.x used to do) drop down to using a <tt class="filename">printers.def</tt> (and all associated
	parameters). The make_printerdef tool is removed and there is no backward compatibility for this.
	</p></li><li><p>You need to install a Windows 9x/Me driver into the
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share for a printer on your Samba
	host. The driver files will be stored in the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>WIN40/0</em></span></span>&#8221; subdirectory of
	<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>, and some other settings and information go
	into the printing-related TDBs.</p></li><li><p>If you want to migrate an existing
	<tt class="filename">printers.def</tt> file into the new setup, the
	only current
	solution is to use the Windows NT APW to install the NT drivers
	and the 9x/Me drivers. This can be scripted using smbclient and
	rpcclient. See the Imprints installation client at:
	</p><p>
		<a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://imprints.sourceforge.net/</a>
	</p><p>
	for an example. See also the discussion of rpcclient usage in the

Do not confuse the root password which is valid for the UNIX system (and in most cases stored in the
form of a one-way hash in a file named <tt class="filename">/etc/shadow</tt>), with the password used to
authenticate against Samba. Samba does not know the UNIX password. Root access to Samba resources
requires that a Samba account for root must first be created. This is done with the <span><b class="command">smbpasswd</b></span>
command as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbpasswd -a root

Do not use the existing UNIX print system spool directory for the Samba spool directory. It may seem
convenient and a savings of space, but it only leads to problems. The two must be separate.
