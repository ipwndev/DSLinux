Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

;
; This registry key is needed for a Windows XP Client to join
; and logon to a Samba domain. Note: Samba 2.2.3a contained 
; this key in a broken format which did nothing to the registry - 
; however XP reported "registry key imported". If in doubt
; check the key by hand with regedit.

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters]
