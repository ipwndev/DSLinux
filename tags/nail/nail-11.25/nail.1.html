     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Nail</I> is an intelligent mail processing system, which has
a command syntax reminiscent of
<a href=http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/man/ed.1.html><i>ed</i></a>(1)
with lines replaced by messages.
It is based on Berkeley Mail 8.1,
is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
<B>mailx</B> command,
and offers extensions
for MIME, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and S/MIME.
<I>Nail</I> provides enhanced
features for interactive use, such as caching and disconnected
operation for IMAP, message threading, scoring, and filtering.
It is also usable as a mail batch language, both for sending
and receiving mail.
<P>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To send a message to one or more people,
<I>nail</I> can be invoked with arguments
which are the names of people
to whom the mail will be sent.
The user is then expected to type in his message,
followed by an &#39;control-D&#39; at the beginning of a line.
The section below Replying to
or originating mail,
describes some features of <I>nail</I>
available to help when composing letters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=4>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Reading mail</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In normal usage <I>nail</I> is given no arguments
and checks the user&#39;s mail out of the post office,
then prints out a one line header
of each message found.
The current message is initially
the first message (numbered 1)
and can be printed using the print command
which can be abbreviated &#39;p&#39;).
The user can move among the messages
much as he moves between lines in
<a href=http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/man/ed.1.html><i>ed</i></a>(1),
with the commands &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; moving backwards and forwards,
and simple numbers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=5>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Disposing of mail</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After examining a message
the user can delete &#39;d&#39;) the message
or reply &#39;r&#39;) to it.
Deletion causes the <I>nail</I> program
to forget about the message.
This is not irreversible;
the message can be undeleted &#39;u&#39;)
by giving its number,
or the <I>nail</I> session can be aborted
by giving the exit &#39;x&#39;) command.
Deleted messages will, however,
usually disappear never to be seen again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=6>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Specifying messages</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commands such as print and delete
can be given a list of message numbers
as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.
Thus &#39;<I>delete 1 2</I>&#39; deletes messages 1 and 2,
while &#39;<I>delete 1-5</I>&#39; deletes messages 1 through 5.
In sorted or threaded mode (see the
<I>sort</I> and
<I>thread</I> commands),
&#39;<I>delete 1-5</I>&#39; deletes the messages
that are located between (and including) messages 1 through 5
in the sorted/threaded order,
as shown in the header summary.
The following special message names exist:

All messages that satisfy the given IMAP-style SEARCH
<I>criterion</I>. This addressing mode is available with all types of folders;

within the quotes,
only backslash &#39;&#92;&#39; is recognized as an escape character.
All string searches are case-insensitive.
When the description indicates
that the &#39;envelope&#39; representation of an address field is used,
this means that the search string is checked against
both a list constructed as
<PRE>
<P>
<B>("</B><I>real name</I><B>" "</B><I>source-route</I><B>" "</B><I>local-part</I><B>" "</B><I>domain-part</I><B>")</B>

as with &#39;(or&nbsp;a&nbsp;(or&nbsp;b&nbsp;c))&#39;;
&#39;(or&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)&#39; means ((a or b) and c).
For a simple &#39;or&#39; operation of independent criteria

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
<I>reply</I> command can be used
to set up a response to a message,
sending it back to the person who it was from.
Text the user types in then,
up to an end-of-file,
defines the contents of the message.
While the user is composing a message,
<I>nail</I> treats lines beginning with the character &#39;~&#39; specially.
For instance, typing &#39;~m&#39; (alone on a line)
will place a copy of the current message into the response
right shifting it by a tabstop
(see
<I>indentprefix</I> variable, below).
Other escapes will set up subject fields,
add and delete recipients to the message,
attach files to it
and allow the user to escape to an editor
to revise the message
or to a shell to run some commands.
(These options are given in the summary below.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is also possible to create
a personal distribution lists so that,
for instance, the user can send mail
to &#39;<I>cohorts</I>&#39; and have it go
to a group of people.
Such lists can be defined by placing a line like
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;       <B>alias</B><I> cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in the file .mailrc in the user&#39;s home directory.
The current list of such aliases
can be displayed with the alias command in <I>nail</I>.
System wide distribution lists can be created
by editing /etc/aliases, see
<I>aliases</I>(5)
and
<I>sendmail</I>(8);
these are kept in a different syntax.
In mail the user sends,
personal aliases will be expanded
in mail sent to others so that
they will be able to reply to the recipients.
System wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent,
but any reply returned to the machine
will have the system wide alias expanded
as all mail goes through sendmail.

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When an address is used to name a recipient
(in any of To, Cc, or Bcc),
names of local mail folders
and pipes to external commands
can also be specified;
the message text is then written to them.
The rules are: Any name which starts with a
&#39;<B>|</B>&#39; character specifies a pipe,
the command string following the &#39;|&#39;
is executed and the message is sent to its standard input;
any other name which contains a
&#39;<B>@</B>&#39; character is treated as a mail address;
any other name which starts with a
&#39;<B>+</B>&#39; character specifies a folder name;
any other name which contains a
&#39;<B>/</B>&#39; character
but no
&#39;<B>!</B>&#39; or
&#39;<B>%</B>&#39; character before also specifies a folder name;
what remains is treated as a mail address.
Compressed folders are handled as described for the

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; MIME types</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For any outgoing attachment,
<I>nail</I> tries to determine the content type.
It does this by reading MIME type files
whose lines have the following syntax:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;       <I>type</I><B>/</B><I>subtype      extension </I>[<I>extension </I>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]
<P>
</PRE>
where type/subtype are strings describing the file contents,
and extension is the part of a filename starting after the last dot.
Any line not immediately beginning with an ASCII alphabetical character is
ignored by <I>nail</I>.
If there is a match with the extension of the file to attach,
the given type/subtype pair is used.
Otherwise, or if the filename has no extension,
the content types text/plain or application/octet-stream are used,
the first for text or international text files,
the second for any file that contains formatting characters
other than newlines and horizontal tabulators.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Character sets</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Nail</I> normally detects the character set of the terminal
using the LC_CTYPE locale setting.
If the locale cannot be used appropriately,
the <I>ttycharset</I> variable should be set
to provide an explicit value.
When reading messages,
their text is converted to the terminal character set if possible.
Unprintable characters and illegal byte sequences are detected
and replaced by Unicode substitute characters or question marks
unless the
<I>print-all-chars</I> is set at initialization time.
<P>
The character set for outgoing messages
is not necessarily the same
as the one used on the terminal.
If an outgoing text message
contains characters not representable in US-ASCII,
the character set being used
must be declared within its header.
Permissible values can be declared
using the <I>sendcharsets</I> variable,
separated by commas;
<I>nail</I> tries each of the values in order
and uses the first appropriate one.
If the message contains characters that cannot be represented
in any of the given character sets,
the message will not be sent,
and its text will be saved to the &#39;dead.letter&#39; file.
Messages that contains NUL bytes are not converted.
<P>
Outgoing attachments are also not converted even if they are plain text.
If the
<I>sendcharsets</I> variable contains more than one character set name,
the
<I>~@</I> tilde escape will ask for the character sets for individual attachments
if it is invoked without arguments.
<P>
Best results are usually achieved
when
<I>nail</I> is run in a UTF-8 locale
on a UTF-8 capable terminal.
In this setup,
characters from various countries can be displayed,
while it is still possible to use more simple
character sets for sending
to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Commands</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each command is typed on a line by itself,
and may take arguments following the command word.
The command need not be typed in its entirety -
the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.
For commands which take message lists as arguments,
if no message list is given,
then the next message forward which satisfies
the command&#39;s requirements is used.
If there are no messages forward of the current message,
the search proceeds backwards,
and if there are no good messages at all,
<I>nail</I> types &#39;<I>applicable messages</I>&#39; and aborts the command.
If the command begins with a <I>#</I> sign,
the line is ignored.
<P>
The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:
<TABLE cellpadding=3><!-- tsb: The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:

An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes
"" or single-quotes &#39;&#39;; any white space, shell
word expansion, or backslash characters within the quotes
are treated literally as part of the argument.
A double-quote will be treated literally within
single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of
the quote marks occur only when they are paired at the
beginning and end of the argument.

<B>account</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
(ac) Creates, selects or lists
an email account.
An account is formed by a group of commands,
primarily of those to set variables.
With two arguments,
of which the second is a &#39;{&#39;,
the first argument gives an account name,
and the following lines create a group of commands for that account
until a line containing a single &#39;}&#39; appears.
With one argument,
the previously created group of commands
for the account name is executed,
and a
<I>folder</I> command is executed for the system mailbox or inbox
of that account.
Without arguments,
the list of accounts and their contents are printed.
As an example,
<P>
<PRE>
&nbsp;   <B>account</B><I> myisp</I> <B>{</B>
&nbsp;       set folder=imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example

which file he is currently reading.
If an argument is given,
it will write out changes
(such as deletions) the user has made
in the current file and read in
the new file.
Some special conventions are recognized for the name.
<B>#</B> means the previous file,
<B>%</B> means the invoking user&#39;s system mailbox,
<B>%</B><I>user</I> means <I>user&#39;s</I> system mailbox,
<B>&amp;</B> means the invoking user&#39;s mbox file,
and <B>+</B><I>file</I><I> means a </I><I>file</I> in the folder directory.
<B>%:</B><I>filespec</I> expands to the same value as <I>filespec</I>,
but the file is handled as a system mailbox
e.&nbsp;g. by the mbox and save commands.
If the name matches one of the strings defined with the
<I>shortcut</I> command,
it is replaced by its long form and expanded.
If the name ends with <B>.gz</B> or <B>.bz2</B>,
it is treated as compressed with
<I>gzip</I>(1)
or
<I>bzip2</I>(1),
respectively.
Likewise, if <I>name</I> does not exist,
but either <I>name</I><B>.gz</B> or <I>name</I><B>.bz2</B> exists,
the compressed file is used.
If <I>name</I> refers to a directory
with the subdirectories &#39;tmp&#39;, &#39;new&#39;, and &#39;cur&#39;,
it is treated as a folder in
<I>maildir</I> format.
A name of the form
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;      <I>protocol</I><B>://</B>[<I>user</I><B>@</B>]<I>host</I>[<B>:</B><I>port</I>][<B>/</B><I>file</I>]
<P>

is taken as an Internet mailbox specification.
The supported protocols are currently
<B>imap</B> (IMAP v4r1),
<B>imaps</B> (IMAP with SSL/TLS encryption),
<B>pop3</B> (POP3),
and
<B>pop3s</B> (POP3 with SSL/TLS encryption).
If
<I>user</I> contains special characters, in particular &#39;/&#39; or &#39;%&#39;,
they must be escaped in URL notation,
as &#39;%2F&#39; or &#39;%25&#39;.
The optional
<I>file</I> part applies to IMAP only;
if it is omitted,
the default &#39;INBOX&#39; is used.
If <I>nail</I> is connected to an IMAP server,
a name of the form <B>@</B><I>mailbox</I>
refers to the <I>mailbox</I> on that server.
If the &#39;folder&#39; variable refers to an IMAP account,
the special name &#39;%&#39; selects the &#39;INBOX&#39; on that account.

Saveignore is to save what ignore is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are filtered out
when saving a message by save
or when automatically saving to mbox.
This command should only be applied to header fields
that do not contain information needed to decode the message,
as MIME content fields do.
If saving messages on an IMAP account,
ignoring fields makes it impossible
to copy the data directly on the server,
thus operation usually becomes much slower.

Saveretain is to save what retain is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are the only ones

or when automatically saving to mbox.
Saveretain overrides saveignore.
The use of this command is strongly discouraged
since it may strip header fields
that are needed to decode the message correctly.

<B>chained-junk-tokens</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Normally, the Bayesian junk mail filter bases its classifications
on single word tokens extracted from messages.
If this option is set,
adjacent words are combined to pairs,
which are then used as additional tokens.
This usually improves the accuracy of the filter,
but also increases the junk mail database
five- to tenfold.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>datefield</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
The date in a header summary

<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>disconnected</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When an IMAP mailbox is selected and this variable is set,
no connection to the server is initiated.
Instead, data is obtained from the local cache (see
<I>imap-cache</I>). Mailboxes that are not present in the cache
and messages that have not yet entirely been fetched from the server
are not available;
to fetch all messages in a mailbox at once,
the command &#39;copy * /dev/null&#39; can be used
while still in
<I>online</I> mode.
Changes that are made to IMAP mailboxes in disconnected mode
are queued and committed later
when a connection to that server is opened in online mode.
This procedure is not completely reliable
since it cannot be guaranteed that the IMAP unique identifiers (UIDs)
on the server still match the ones in the cache at that time.
Data is saved to &#39;dead.letter&#39; when this problem occurs.

<B>keep</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
This option causes <I>nail</I> to truncate the user&#39;s system mailbox
instead of deleting it when it is empty.
This should always be set,
since it prevents malicious users

in a world-writable spool directory.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>keepsave</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When a message is saved,
it is usually discarded

causes all saved message to be retained.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>markanswered</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When a message is replied to

it is marked as having been answered.
This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system;
it just causes messages to be marked in the header summary,
and makes them specially addressable.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>metoo</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
Usually, when a group is expanded
that contains the sender,
the sender is removed from the expansion.

the sender to be included in the group.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>newmail</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Checks for new mail in the current folder
each time the prompt is printed.
For IMAP mailboxes,
the server is then polled for new mail,
which may result in delayed operation
if the connection to the server is slow.
A
<I>maildir</I> folder must be re-scanned to determine
if new mail has arrived.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
If this variable is set to the special value
<B>nopoll</B>, an IMAP server is not actively asked for new mail,
but new mail may still be detected and announced
with any other IMAP command that is sent to the server.
A
<I>maildir</I> folder is not scanned then.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
In any case,
the IMAP server may send notifications about messages
that have been deleted on the server
by another process or client.
In this case, &#39;Expunged <I>n</I> messages&#39; is printed

</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>noheader</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>

<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>pop3-use-apop</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
If this variable is set,
the APOP authentication method is used
when a connection to a POP3 server is initiated.
The advantage of this method over the usual USER/PASS authentication is
that the password is not sent over the network in clear text.
The connection fails
if the server does not support the APOP command.

<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>print-all-chars</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
This option causes all characters to be considered printable.
It is only effective if given in a startup file.
With this option set,
some character sequences in messages

</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>print-alternatives</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When a MIME message part of type

This option is set by default.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>searchheaders</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
If this option is set, then

<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>smime-sign</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
If this variable is set,
outgoing messages are S/MIME signed with the user&#39;s private key.
Signing a message enables a recipient to verify
that the sender used a valid certificate,
that the email addresses in the certificate
match those in the message header,
and that the message content has not been altered.
It does not change the message text,
and people will be able to read the message as usual.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>smime-no-default-ca</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>

There are two pitfalls associated with this:
First, the message id of outgoing messages is not known anymore.
Second, an expert may still use the remaining information in the header
to track down the originating mail user agent.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>verbose</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Setting the option verbose is the same
as using the -v flag on the command line.
When <I>nail</I> runs in verbose mode,
details of the actual message delivery

as well as of other internal processes,
are displayed on the user&#39;s terminal,
This is sometimes useful to debug problems.
<I>Nail</I> prints all data that is sent to remote servers in clear texts,

The default is <I>8bit</I>.
In case the mail transfer system
is not ESMTP compliant,
<I>quoted-printable</I> should be used instead.
If there is no need to encode a message,
<I>7bit</I> transfer mode is used,

Binary data is always encoded in <I>base64</I> mode.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>escape</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>

<B>folder</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The name of the directory to use

All folder names that begin with &#39;+&#39;
refer to files below that directory.
If the directory name begins with a &#39;/&#39;,
<I>nail</I> considers it to be an absolute pathname;
otherwise, the folder directory is found

The directory name may also refer to an IMAP account;
any names that begin with &#39;+&#39;
then refer to IMAP mailboxes on that account.
An IMAP folder is normally given in the form
<P>
<PRE>
&nbsp;   imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example

With such servers,
a folder name of the form
<P>

Folder names prefixed by &#39;+&#39; will then refer to folders below &#39;INBOX&#39;,

the macro corresponding to the value of this variable is executed.
Unlike other folder specifications,
the fully expanded name of a folder, without metacharacters,

<B>from</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The address (or a list of addresses)
to put into the <I>&#39;From:&#39;</I> field of the message header.
If replying to a message,
these addresses are handled as if they were in the alternates list.
<!--  If this variable is set, -->
<!--  a \fI`Sender:'\fR field containing the user's name -->
<!--  is also generated, -->

However, if the files are modified by Mozilla
while
<I>nail</I> is running,
it will print a &#39;Bad database&#39; message.
It may be necessary to create copies of these files

its text is filtered through the value of this variable
interpreted as a shell command.
Special care must be taken when using such commands
as mail viruses may be distributed by this method;
if messages of type

Normally, a heading consisting of &#39;Fromheaderfield wrote:&#39; is printed
before the quotation.
If the string <I>noheading</I> is assigned to the <I>quote</I> variable,
this heading is omitted.
If the string <I>headers</I> is assigned,
the headers selected by the ignore/retain commands
are printed above the message body,
thus <I>quote</I> acts like an automatic ~m command then.
If the string <I>allheaders</I> is assigned,
all headers are printed above the message body,

That is, the list should start with e.g.
&#39;iso-8859-1&#39; for compatibility with older mail clients,
might contain some other language-specific character sets,

This field needs not normally be present.
It is, however, required
if the &#39;From:&#39; field contains more than one address.
It can also be used to indicate that a message
was sent on behalf of somebody other;
in this case, &#39;From:&#39; should contain the address
of the person that took responsibility for the message,
and &#39;Sender:&#39; should contain the address
of the person that actually sent the message.
The

When decrypting messages,
their recipient fields (To: and Cc:) are searched for addresses

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The
<I>nail</I> command has two distinct usages, according to whether one
wants to send or receive mail.
Sending mail is simple: to send a
message to a user whose email address is, say,
&lt;bill@host.example&gt;,
use the shell
command:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>nail</B><I> bill@host.example</I>
<P>
</PRE>
then type your message.
<I>Nail</I> will prompt you for a message
<I>subject</I> first;
after that, lines typed by you form the body of the message.
When you reach the end of the message, type
an EOT (control-d) at the beginning of a line, which will cause
<I>nail</I> to echo &#39;EOT&#39; and return you to the shell.
<P>
If, while you are composing the message
you decide that you do not wish to send it after all, you can
abort the letter with a <FONT size=-2>RUBOUT</FONT>.  Typing a single <FONT size=-2>RUBOUT</FONT>
causes
<I>nail</I> to print &#39;(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)&#39;.
Typing a second
<FONT size=-2>RUBOUT</FONT> causes
<I>nail</I> to save your partial letter on the file
<I>dead.letter</I> in your home directory and abort the letter.
Once you have
sent mail to someone, there is no way to undo the act, so be
careful.
<P>
If you want to send the same message to several other people,
you can list their email addresses on the command line.
Thus,
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>nail</B><I> sam@workstation.example bob@server.example</I>
&nbsp;   Subject: Fees
&nbsp;   Tuition fees are due next Friday.  Don&#39;t forget!
&nbsp;   &lt;Control-d&gt;
&nbsp;   EOT
&nbsp;   $
<P>
</PRE>
will send the reminder to <I>&lt;sam@workstation.example&gt;</I>.
and
<I>&lt;bob@server.example&gt;</I>.
<P>
To read your mail, simply type
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>nail</B>
<P>
</PRE>
<I>Nail</I> will respond by typing its version number and date and then listing
the messages you have waiting.
Then it will type a prompt and await your command.
The messages are assigned numbers starting with 1&#151;you
refer to the messages with these numbers.
<I>Nail</I> keeps track of which messages are
<I>new</I> (have been sent since you last read your mail) and
<I>read</I> (have been read by you).  New messages have an
<B>N</B> next to them in the header listing and old, but unread messages have
a
<B>U</B> next to them.
<I>Nail</I> keeps track of new/old and read/unread messages by putting a
header field called
<I>Status</I> into your messages.
<P>
To look at a specific message, use the
<I>type</I> command, which may be abbreviated to simply
<I>t .</I> For example, if you had the following messages:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   O 1 drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep  1 19:52  18/631 "Fees"
&nbsp;   O 2 sam@friends.example  Thu Sep  2 00:08  30/895
<P>
</PRE>
you could examine the first message by giving the command:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>type</B> 1
<P>
</PRE>
which might cause
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .N -->
to respond with, for example:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   Message  1:
&nbsp;   From drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep  1 19:52:25 2004
&nbsp;   Subject: Fees
&nbsp;   Status: R
<P>
&nbsp;   Tuition fees are due next Wednesday.  Don&#39;t forget!
<P>
</PRE>
<P>
Many
<I>nail</I> commands that operate on messages take a message number as an
argument like the
<I>type</I> command.
For these commands, there is a notion of a current message.
When you enter the
<I>nail</I> program, the current message is initially the first
(or the first recent) one.
Thus, you can often omit the message number and use, for example,
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>t</B>
<P>
</PRE>
to type the current message.
As a further shorthand, you can type a message
by simply giving its message number.
Hence,
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   1
<P>
</PRE>
would type the first message.
<P>
Frequently, it is useful to read the messages in your mailbox in order,
one after another.
You can read the next message in
<I>nail</I> by simply typing a newline.
As a special case, you can type a newline as your first command to
<I>nail</I> to type the first message.
<P>
If, after typing a message, you wish to immediately send a reply,
you can do so with the
<I>reply</I> command.
This command,
like
<I>type</I>, takes a message number as an argument.
<I>nail</I> then begins a message addressed to the user who sent you the message.
You may then type in your letter in reply, followed by a &lt;control-d&gt;
at the beginning of a line, as before.
<P>
Note that
<I>nail</I> copies the subject header from the original message.
This is useful in that correspondence
about a particular matter will tend to retain the same subject heading,
making it easy to recognize.
If there are other header fields in the message,
like &#39;Cc:&#39;,
the information found will also be used.
<P>
Sometimes you will receive a message that has been sent to
several people and wish to reply only
to the person who sent it.
<I>Reply</I> with a capital
<I>R</I> replies to a message, but sends a copy to the sender only.
<P>
If you wish, while reading your mail, to send a message to someone,
but not as a reply to one of your messages, you can send the message
directly with the
<I>mail</I> command, which takes as arguments the names of the recipients you wish
to send to.
For example, to send a message to &lt;frank@machine.example&gt;,
you would do:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>mail</B><I> frank@machine.example</I>
</PRE>
<P>
To delete a message from the mail folder,
you can use the
<I>delete</I> command.
In addition to not saving deleted messages,
<I>nail</I> will not let you type them, either.
The effect is to make the message disappear
altogether, along with its number.
<P>
Many features of
<I>nail</I> can be tailored to your liking with the
<I>set</I> command.
The
<I>set</I> command has two forms, depending on whether you are setting a
<I>binary</I> option or a
<I>valued</I> option.
Binary options are either on or off.  For example, the
<I>askcc</I> option informs
<I>nail</I> that each time you send a message, you want it to prompt you for
a &#39;Cc:&#39; header,
to be included in the message.
To set the
<I>askcc</I> option, you would type
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set</B> askcc
</PRE>
<P>
Valued options are values which
<I>nail</I> uses to adapt to your tastes.
For example, the
<I>record</I> option tells
<I>nail</I> where to save messages sent by you,
and is specified by
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set</B> record=Sent
<P>
</PRE>
for example.
Note that no spaces are allowed in
<I>set record=Sent .</I> <P>
<I>Nail</I> includes a simple facility for maintaining groups of messages together
in folders.
To use the folder facility, you must tell
<I>nail</I> where you wish to keep your folders.
Each folder of messages will be a single file.
For convenience, all of your folders are kept in
a single directory of your choosing.
To tell
<I>nail</I> where your folder directory is, put a line of the form
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set folder=</B><I>letters</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in your
<I>.mailrc</I> file.
If, as in the example above,
your folder directory does not begin with a &#39;/&#39;,
<I>nail</I> will assume that your folder directory is to be found starting from
your home directory.
<P>
Anywhere a file name is expected, you can use a folder name, preceded
with &#39;+&#39;.
For example, to put a message into a folder with the
<I>save</I> command, you can use:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>save +</B><I>classwork</I>
<P>
</PRE>
to save the current message in the
<I>classwork</I> folder.
If the
<I>classwork</I> folder does not yet exist, it will be created.
Note that messages which are saved with the
<I>save</I> command are automatically removed from your system mailbox.
<P>
In order to make a copy of a message in a folder without causing
that message to be removed from your system mailbox, use the
<I>copy</I> command, which is identical in all other respects to the
<I>save</I> command.
<P>
The
<I>folder</I> command
can be used to direct
<I>nail</I> to the contents of a different folder.
For example,
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>folder +</B><I>classwork</I>
<P>
</PRE>
directs
<I>nail</I> to read the contents of the
<I>classwork</I> folder.
All of the commands that you can use on your system
mailbox are also applicable to folders, including
<I>type</I>, <I>delete</I>, and
<I>reply</I>. To inquire which folder you are currently editing, use simply:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>folder</B>
</PRE>
<P>
To list your current set of folders, use the
<I>folders</I> command.
<P>
Finally, the
<I>help</I> command is available to print out a brief summary of the most important
<I>nail</I> commands.
<P>
While typing in a message to be sent to others, it is often
useful to be able to invoke the text editor on the partial message,
print the message, execute a shell command, or do some other
auxiliary function.
<I>Nail</I> provides these capabilities through
<I>tilde escapes ,</I> which consist of a tilde (~) at the beginning of a line, followed by
a single character which indicates the function to be performed.
For example, to print the text of the message so far, use:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>~p</B>
<P>
</PRE>
which will print a line of dashes, the recipients of your message, and
the text of the message so far.
A list of the most important tilde escapes is available with &#39;~?&#39;.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; IMAP or POP3 client setup</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First you need the following data from your ISP:
the host name of the IMAP or POP3 server,
user name and password for this server,
and a notice whether the server uses SSL/TLS encryption.
Assuming the host name is &#39;server.myisp.example&#39;
and your user name for that server is &#39;mylogin&#39;,
you can refer to this account using the
<I>folder</I> command or
<I>-f</I> command line option with
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>imaps://</B><I>mylogin</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I>
<P>
</PRE>
(This string is not necessarily the same as your Internet mail address.)
You can replace &#39;imaps://&#39; with &#39;imap://&#39;
if the server does not support SSL/TLS.
(If SSL/TLS support is built using NSS, the
<I>nss-config-dir</I> variable must be set before a connection can be initiated,
see above).
Use &#39;pop3s://&#39; or &#39;pop3://&#39; if the server does not offer IMAP.
You should use IMAP if you can, though;
first because it requires fewer network operations than POP3
to get the contents of the mailbox
and is thus faster;
and second because message attributes
are maintained by the IMAP server,
so you can easily distinguish new and old messages
each time you connect.
Even if the server does not accept IMAPS or POP3S connections,
it is possible that it supports the STARTTLS method
to make a session SSL/TLS encrypted
after the initial connection has been performed,
but before authentication begins.
The only reliable method to see if this works is to try it; enter one of
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set imap-use-starttls</B>
&nbsp;   <B>set pop3-use-starttls</B>
<P>
</PRE>
before you initiate the connection.
<P>
As you probably want messages to be deleted from this account
after saving them,
prefix it with &#39;<I>%:</I>&#39;.
The
<I>shortcut</I> command can be used to avoid typing that many characters
every time you want to connect:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>shortcut </B><I>myisp</I><B> </B><B>%:imaps://</B><I>mylogin</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I>
<P>
</PRE>
You might want to put this string into a startup file.
As the
<I>shortcut</I> command is
<I>nail-</I>specific and will confuse other
<I>mailx</I> implementations,
it should not be used in
<I>~/.mailrc</I>, instead, put
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set NAIL_EXTRA_RC=</B><I>~/.nailrc</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in
<I>~/.mailrc</I> and create a file
<I>~/.nailrc</I> containing the
<I>shortcut</I> command above.
You can then access your remote mailbox by invoking
&#39;nail -f <I>myisp</I>&#39; on the command line,
or by executing &#39;fi <I>myisp</I>&#39; within nail.
<P>
If you want to use more than one IMAP mailbox on a server,
or if you want to use the IMAP server for mail storage too,
the
<I>account</I> command
(which is also <I>nail-</I>specific)
is more appropriate than the
<I>shortcut</I> command.
You can put the following in
<I>~/.nailrc</I>: <P>
<PRE>
&nbsp;   <B>account </B><I>myisp </I><B>{</B>
&nbsp;       <B>set folder=imaps://</B><I>mylogin</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I>
&nbsp;       <B>set record=+</B><I>Sent </I><B>MBOX=+</B><I>mbox </I><B>outfolder</B>
&nbsp;   <B>}</B>
</PRE>
<P>
and can then access incoming mail for this account by invoking
&#39;nail -A <I>myisp</I>&#39; on the command line,
or by executing &#39;ac <I>myisp</I>&#39; within nail.
After that,
a command like &#39;copy <I>1</I> +<I>otherfolder</I>&#39;
will refer to <I>otherfolder</I> on the IMAP server.
In particular,
&#39;fi &amp;&#39; will change to the
<I>mbox</I> folder,
and
&#39;fi +Sent&#39; will show your recorded sent mail,
with both folders located on the IMAP server.
<P>
<I>Nail</I> will ask you for a password string
each time you connect to a remote account.
If you can reasonably trust the security
of your workstation,
you can give this password in the startup file as
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set password-</B><I>mylogin</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I><B>="</B><I>SECRET</I><B>"</B>
<P>
</PRE>
You should change the permissions of this file to 0600, see
<I>chmod</I>(1).
<P>
<I>Nail</I> supports different authentication methods for both IMAP and POP3.
If Kerberos is used at your location,
you can try to activate GSSAPI-based authentication by
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set imap-auth=gssapi</B>
<P>
</PRE>
The advantage of this method is that
<I>nail</I> does not need to know your password at all,
nor needs to send sensitive data over the network.
Otherwise, the options
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set imap-auth=cram-md5</B>
&nbsp;   <B>set pop3-use-apop</B>
<P>
</PRE>
for IMAP and POP3, respectively,
offer authentication methods
that avoid to send the password in clear text over the network,
which is especially important if SSL/TLS cannot be used.
If the server does not offer any of these authentication methods,
conventional user/password based authentication must be used.
It is sometimes helpful to set the
<I>verbose</I> option when authentication problems occur.
<I>Nail</I> will display all data sent to the server in clear text on the screen
with this option,
including passwords.
You should thus take care that no unauthorized person
can look at your terminal when this option is set.
<P>
If you regularly use the same workstation
to access IMAP accounts,
you can greatly enhance performance
by enabling local caching of IMAP messages.
For any message that has been fully or partially fetched from the server,
a local copy is made and is used when the message is accessed again,
so most data is transferred over the network once only.
To enable the IMAP cache,
select a local directory name and put
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set imap-cache=</B><I>~/localdirectory</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in the startup file.
All files within that directory
can be overwritten or deleted by <I>nail</I> at any time,
so you should not use the directory to store other information.
<P>
Once the cache contains some messages,
it is not strictly necessary anymore
to open a connection to the IMAP server
to access them.
When <I>nail</I> is invoked with the <I>-D</I> option,
or when the
<I>disconnected</I> variable is set,
only cached data is used
for any folder you open.
Messages that have not yet been completely cached
are not available then,
but all other messages can be handled
as usual.
Changes made to IMAP mailboxes in
<I>disconnected</I> mode are committed to the IMAP server
next time it is used in
<I>online</I> mode.
Synchronizing the local status
with the status on the server
is thus partially within your responsibility;
if you forget to initiate a connection to the server again
before you leave your location,
changes made on one workstation
are not available on others.
Also if you alter IMAP mailboxes from a workstation
while uncommitted changes are still pending on another,
the latter data may become invalid.
The same might also happen because of internal server status changes.
You should thus carefully evaluate this feature in your environment
before you rely on it.
<P>
Many servers will close the connection
after a short period of inactivity. Use one of
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set pop3-keepalive=</B><I>30</I>
&nbsp;   <B>set imap-keepalive=</B><I>240</I>
<P>
</PRE>
to send a keepalive message each 30 seconds for POP3,
or each 4 minutes for IMAP.
<P>
If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS server,
try the
<I>ssl-rand-egd</I> and
<I>ssl-rand-file</I> variables (see the OpenSSL FAQ for more information)
or specify the protocol version with
<I>ssl-method</I>. Contact your ISP
if you need a client certificate
or if verification of the server certificate fails.
If the failed certificate is indeed valid,
fetch its CA certificate by executing the shell command
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>openssl s_client &lt;/dev/null -showcerts -connect &#92;
&nbsp;          </B><I>server.myisp.example</I><B>:</B><I>imaps</I><B> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee </B><I>log</I>
<P>
</PRE>
(see
<I>s_client</I>(1))
and put it into the file specified with
<I>ssl-ca-file</I>. The data you need is located at the end of the certificate chain
within (and including) the &#39;BEGIN CERTIFICATE&#39;
and &#39;END CERTIFICATE&#39; lines.
(Note that it is possible to fetch
a forged certificate by this method.
You can only completely rely
on the authenticity of the CA certificate
if you fetch it in a way that is trusted by other means,
such as by personally receiving the certificate on storage media.)

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Creating a score file or message filter</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The scoring commands are best separated
from other configuration for clarity,
and are mostly
<I>nail</I> specific.
It is thus recommended to put them in a separate file
that is sourced from your NAIL_EXTRA_RC as follows:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>source</B><I> ~/.scores</I>
<P>
</PRE>
The <I>.scores</I> file could then look as follows:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>define</B> <I>list</I> {
&nbsp;       <B>score</B> (subject "important discussion") +10
&nbsp;       <B>score</B> (subject "annoying discussion") -10
&nbsp;       <B>score</B> (from "nicefellow@goodnet") +15
&nbsp;       <B>score</B> (from "badguy@poornet") -5
&nbsp;       <B>move</B> (header x-spam-flag "+++++") <I>+junk</I>
&nbsp;   }
&nbsp;   <B>set folder-hook-</B>imap://user@host/public.list=<I>list</I>
<P>
</PRE>
In this scheme,
you would see any mail from &#39;nicefellow@goodnet&#39;,
even if the surrounding discussion is annoying;
but you normally would not see mail from &#39;badguy@poornet&#39;,
unless he participates in the important discussion.
Messages that are marked with five or more plus characters
in their &#39;X-Spam-Flag&#39; field
(inserted by some server-side filtering software)
are moved to the folder &#39;junk&#39; in the
<I>folder</I> directory.
<P>
Be aware that all criteria in () lead to substring matches,
so you would also score messages
from e.g. &#39;notsobadguy@poornetmakers&#39; negative here.
It is possible to select addresses exactly using <I>"address"</I>
message specifications,
but these cannot be executed remotely
and will thus cause all headers
to be downloaded from IMAP servers while looking for matches.
<P>
When searching messages on an IMAP server,
best performance is usually achieved
by sending as many criteria as possible
in one large () specification,
because each single such specification
will result in a separate network operation.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Activating the Bayesian filter</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bayesian junk mail filter works
by examining the words contained in messages.
You decide yourself what a good and what a bad message is.
Thus the resulting filter is your very personal one;
once it is correctly set up,
it will filter only messages similar to those
previously specified by you.
<P>
To use the Bayesian filter,
a location for the junk mail database must be defined first:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set junkdb=</B><I>~/.junkdb</I>
<P>
</PRE>
The junk mail database does not contain
actual words extracted from messages,
but hashed representations of them.
A foreign person who can read the database
could only examine the frequency of previously known words
in your mail.
<P>
If you have sufficient disk space (several 10&nbsp;MB) available,
it is recommended that you set the
<I>chained-junk-tokens</I> option.
The filter will then also consider two-word tokens,
improving its accuracy.
<P>
A set of good messages and junk messages must now be available;
it is also possible to use the incoming new messages for this purpose,
although it will of course take some time
until the filter becomes useful then.
Do not underestimate the amount of statistical data needed;
some hundred messages are typically necessary
to get satisfactory results,
and many thousand messages for best operation.
You have to pass the good messages to the
<I>good</I> command,
and the junk messages to the
<I>junk</I> command.
If you ever accidentally mark a good message as junk or vice-versa,
call the
<I>ungood</I> or
<I>unjunk</I> command to correct this.
<P>
Once a reasonable amount of statistics has been collected,
new messages can be classified automatically.
The
<I>classify</I> command marks all messages that the filter considers to be junk,
but it does not perform any action on them by default.
It is recommended that you move these messages into a separate
folder just for the case that false positives occur,
or to pass them to the
<I>junk</I> command later again to further improve the junk mail database.
To automatically move incoming junk messages
every time the inbox is opened,
put lines like the following into your
<I>.scores</I> file (or whatever name you gave to the file in the last example):
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>define</B> <I>junkfilter</I> {
&nbsp;       <B>classify (smaller </B><I>20000</I><B>) :n</B>
&nbsp;       <B>move :j</B> <I>+junk</I>
&nbsp;   }
&nbsp;   <B>set folder-hook-</B>imap://user@host/INBOX=<I>junkfilter</I>
<P>
</PRE>
If you set the
<I>verbose</I> option before running the
<I>classify</I> command,
<I>nail</I> prints the words it uses for calculating the junk status
along with their statistical probabilities.
This can help you to find out
why some messages are not classified
as you would like them to be.
To see the statistical probability of a given word,
use the
<I>probability</I> command.
<P>
If a junk message was not recognized as such,
use the
<I>junk</I> command to correct this.
Also if you encounter a false positive
(a good message that was wrongly classified as junk),
pass it to the
<I>good</I> command.
<P>
Since the
<I>classify</I> command must examine the entire text
of all new messages in the respective folder,
this will also cause all of them to be downloaded from the IMAP server.
You should thus restrict the size of messages for automatic filtering.
If server-based filtering is also available,
you might try if that works for you first.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
S/MIME provides two central mechanisms:
message signing and message encryption.
A signed message contains some data in addition
to the regular text.
The data can be used to verify
that the message was sent using a valid certificate,
that the sender&#39;s address in the message header
matches that in the certificate,
and that the message text has not been altered.
Signing a message does not change its regular text;
it can be read regardless of whether the recipient&#39;s software
is able to handle S/MIME.
It is thus usually possible to sign all outgoing messages
if so desired.&#151;Encryption, in contrast,
makes the message text invisible for all people
except those who have access to the secret decryption key.
To encrypt a message,
the specific recipient&#39;s public encryption key must be known.
It is thus not possible to send encrypted mail to people
unless their key has been retrieved
from either previous communication or public key directories.
A message should always be signed before it is encrypted.
Otherwise, it is still possible that the encrypted message text
is altered.
<P>
A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification authority (CA).
A CA is a trusted institution that issues certificates.
For each of these certificates,
it can be verified that it really originates from the CA,
provided that the CA&#39;s own certificate is previously known.
A set of CA certificates is usually delivered with OpenSSL
and installed on your system.
If you trust the source of your OpenSSL software installation,
this offers reasonable security for S/MIME on the Internet.
In general, a certificate cannot be more secure
than the method its CA certificate has been retrieved with, though.
Thus if you download a CA certificate from the Internet,
you can only trust the messages you verify using that certificate
as much as you trust the download process.
<P>
The first thing you need for participating in S/MIME message exchange
is your personal certificate,
including a private key.
The certificate contains public information,
in particular your name and your email address,
and the public key that is used by others
to encrypt messages for you,
and to verify signed messages they supposedly received from you.
The certificate is included in each signed message you send.
The private key must be kept secret.
It is used to decrypt messages that were
previously encrypted with your public key,
and to sign messages.
<P>
For personal use,
it is recommended that you get a S/MIME certificate
from one of the major CAs on the Internet using your WWW browser.
(Many CAs offer such certificates for free.)
You will usually receive
a combined certificate and private key
in PKCS#12 format which
<I>nail</I> does not directly accept
if S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL.
To convert it to PEM format,
use the following shell command:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>openssl pkcs12 -in </B><I>cert.p12</I><B> -out </B><I>cert.pem</I><B> -clcerts &#92;
&nbsp;       -nodes</B>
<P>
</PRE>
If you omit the
<I>-nodes</I> parameter,
you can specifiy an additional
<I>PEM pass phrase</I> for protecting the private key.
<I>Nail</I> will then ask you for that pass phrase
each time it signs or decrypts a message.
You can then use
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set smime-sign-cert-</B><I>myname@myisp.example</I><B>=</B><I>cert.pem</I>
<P>
</PRE>
to make this private key and certificate known to
<I>nail</I>. <P>
If S/MIME support is built using NSS,
the PKCS#12 file must be installed using Mozilla
(provided that
<I>nss-config-dir</I> is set appropriately,
see above),
and no further action is necessary
unless multiple user certificates
for the same email address are installed.
In this case,
the
<I>smime-sign-nickname</I> variable has to be set appropriately.
<P>
You can now sign outgoing messages.
Just use
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set smime-sign</B>
<P>
</PRE>
to do so.
<P>
From each signed message you send,
the recipient can fetch your certificate
and use it to send encrypted mail back to you.
Accordingly if somebody sends you a signed message,
you can do the same.
First use the
<I>verify</I> command to check the validity of the certificate.
After that,
retrieve the certificate and tell
<I>nail</I> that it should use it for encryption:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>certsave</B><I> filename</I>
&nbsp;   <B>set smime-encrypt-</B><I>user@host</I><B>=</B><I>filename</I>
<P>
</PRE>
If S/MIME support is built using NSS,
the saved certificate must be installed using Mozilla.
The value of the
<I>smime-encrypt-user@host</I> is ignored then,
but if multiple certificates for the recipient are available,
the
<I>smime-nickname-user@host</I> variable must be set.
<P>
You should carefully consider
if you prefer to store encrypted messages in decrypted form.
If you do, anybody who has access to your mail folders can read them,
but if you do not,
you might be unable to read them yourself later
if you happen to lose your private key.
The
<I>decrypt</I> command saves messages in decrypted form,
while the
<I>save</I>, <I>copy</I>, and
<I>move</I> commands leave them encrypted.
<P>
Note that neither S/MIME signing nor encryption
applies to message subjects or other header fields.
Thus they may not contain sensitive information
for encrypted messages,
and cannot be trusted even if the message content
has been verified.
When sending signed messages,
it is recommended to repeat any important header information
in the message text.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Using CRLs with S/MIME or SSL/TLS</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Certification authorities (CAs) issue
certificate revocation lists (CRLs) on a regular basis.
These lists contain the serial numbers of certificates
that have been declared invalid after they have been issued.
Such usually happens
because the private key for the certificate has been compromised,
because the owner of the certificate has left
the organization that is mentioned in the certificate,
etc.
To seriously use S/MIME or SSL/TLS verification,
an up-to-date CRL is required for each trusted CA.
There is otherwise no method
to distinguish between valid and invalidated certificates.
<I>Nail</I> currently offers no mechanism to fetch CRLs,
or to access them on the Internet,
so you have to retrieve them by some external mechanism.
<P>
If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using OpenSSL,
<I>nail</I> accepts CRLs in PEM format only;
CRLs in DER format must be converted,
e.g. with the shell command
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   $ <B>openssl crl -inform DER -in </B><I>crl.der</I><B> -out </B><I>crl.pem</I>
<P>
</PRE>
To tell
<I>nail</I> about the CRLs,
a directory
that contains all CRL files
(and no other files)
must be created.
The
<I>smime-crl-dir</I> or
<I>ssl-crl-dir</I> variables, respectively,
must then be set to point to that directory.
After that,
<I>nail</I> requires a CRL to be present
for each CA that is used
to verify a certificate.
<P>
If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using NSS,
CRLs can be imported in Mozilla applications
(provided that
<I>nss-config-dir</I> is set appropriately).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you want to send mail from scripts,
you must be aware that
<I>nail</I> reads the user&#39;s configuration files by default.
So unless your script is only intended for your own personal use
(as e.g. a cron job),
you need to circumvent this by invoking
<I>nail</I> like
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>MAILRC=/dev/null nail -n</B>

You then need to create a configuration for
<I>nail</I> for your script.
This can be done by either pointing the
<I>MAILRC</I> variable to a custom configuration file,
or by passing the configuration in environment variables.
Since many of the configuration options are not valid shell variables, the
<I>env</I> command is useful in this situation.
An invocation could thus look like
<PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Variables in the environment passed to
<I>nail</I> cannot be unset.
<P>
The character set conversion relies
on the
<I>iconv</I>(3)
function.
Its functionality differs widely
between the various system environments
<I>nail</I> runs on.
If the message &#39;Cannot convert from <I>a</I> to <I>b</I>&#39; appears,
either some characters within the message header or text
are not appropriate for the currently selected terminal character set,
or the needed conversion is not supported by the system.
In the first case,
it is necessary to set
an appropriate LC_CTYPE locale (e.g. <I>en_US</I>)
or the
<I>ttycharset</I> variable.
In the second case, the
<I>sendcharsets</I> and
<I>ttycharset</I> variables must be set to the same value
to inhibit character set conversion.
If
<I>iconv()</I> is not available at all,
the value assigned to
<I>sendcharsets</I> must match the character set that is used on the terminal.
<P>
Nail expects input text to be in Unix format,
with lines separated by
<I>newline</I> (^J, &#92;n) characters only.
Non-Unix text files that use
<I>carriage return</I> (^M, &#92;r)

or fix the tools that generate them.
<P>
Limitations with IMAP mailboxes are:
It is not possible to edit messages,
but it is possible to append them.
Thus to edit a message,
create a local copy of it,
edit it, append it,
and delete the original.
The line count for the header display
is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded
from the server.
The marking of messages as &#39;new&#39; is performed by the IMAP server;
use of the
<I>exit</I> command instead of
<I>quit</I> will not cause it to be reset,
and if the
<I>autoinc</I>/<I>newmail</I> variables are unset,
messages that arrived during a session
will not be in state &#39;new&#39; anymore
when the folder is opened again.
Also if commands queued in disconnected mode are committed,
the IMAP server will delete the &#39;new&#39; flag
for all messages in the changed folder,
and new messages will appear as unread
when it is selected for viewing later.
The &#39;flagged&#39;, &#39;answered&#39;, and &#39;draft&#39; attributes are usually permanent,
but some IMAP servers are known to drop them without notification.
<!--  This is why nail does not even check if storing them succeeds. -->
Message numbers may change with IMAP
every time before the prompt is printed
if <I>nail</I> is notified by the server
that messages have been deleted
by some other client or process.
In this case, &#39;Expunged <I>n</I> messages&#39; is printed,
and message numbers may have changed.
<P>
Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are:
It is not possible to edit messages,
they can only be copied and deleted.
The line count for the header display
is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded
from the server.
The status field of a message is maintained by the server
between connections;
some servers do not update it at all,
and with a server that does,
the &#39;exit&#39; command will not cause the message status to be reset.
The &#39;newmail&#39; command and the &#39;newmail&#39; variable
have no effect.
It is not possible to rename or to remove POP3 mailboxes.
<P>
If a
<FONT size=-1>RUBOUT</FONT> (interrupt) is typed while an IMAP or POP3 operation is in progress,
<I>nail</I> will wait until the operation can be safely aborted,
and will then return to the command loop
and print the prompt again.
When a second
<I>RUBOUT</I> is typed while
<I>nail</I> is waiting for the operation to complete,
the operation itself will be canceled.
In this case,
data that has not been fetched yet
will have to be fetched
before the next command can be performed.
If the canceled operation
was using an SSL/TLS encrypted channel,
an error in the SSL transport will very likely result,
and the connection is no longer usable.
<P>
As <I>nail</I> is a mail user agent,
it provides only basic SMTP services.
If it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server,
it will not make further attempts to transfer the message
at a later time,
and it does not leave other information about this condition
than an error message on the terminal
and a &#39;dead.letter&#39; file.
This is usually not a problem if the SMTP server
is located in the same local network
as the computer on which <I>nail</I> is run.
However, care should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP;
it might be better to set up a local SMTP server then
which just acts as a proxy.

<I>Nail</I> immediately contacts the SMTP server (or
<I>/usr/lib/sendmail</I>) even when operating in
<I>disconnected</I> mode.
It would not make much sense for <I>nail</I> to defer outgoing mail
since SMTP servers usually provide
much more elaborated delay handling
than <I>nail</I> could perform as a client.
Thus the recommended setup for sending mail in
<I>disconnected</I> mode is to configure a local SMTP server
such that it sends outgoing mail
as soon as an external network connection is available again,
i.e. to advise it to do that from a network startup script.
