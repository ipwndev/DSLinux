Warning:  You have entered the domain of the reconfigurable penguin.

Things you should know:

(1) The kernel and OS image are in /dev/mtd5, also known as /dev/flash/image. 
    Don't do "eraseall /dev/mtd5" unless you want to reprogram the flash from 
    within xmd.   You probably don't want to do this.  There is currently no
    way to update the kernel from within uClinux itself.  I'm working on it.

(2) Don't "cat /proc/kmsg"!  This is the only guaranteed way I know to crash the 
    kernel.  I don't know why this happens, but there are much bigger problems to 
    solve than that one!  Everything else in /proc seems to work pretty well.

(3) There's a test program called gpio_test.  Run it and see what it does.

(4) /var and /usr are both writable file systems (ext2 on ramdisk).  However, I've 
    had to hack the kernel to get around some mb-gcc bugs to get them working.  It 
    won't take much to break them at the moment, but simple file copies should be OK.

(5) The shell you are running is "sash".  It's pretty simple, no output 
    redirection, no scripting commands (for, case etc), and so on.  You can use 
    the ampersand '&' to launch processes in the background.  Try it, it works!

(6) 'ps' and 'uptime' both work.  See if you can stress the processor then run
    uptime to view the sweat on its brow!  Have a look in /bin to see what other
    familiar *n*x tools are present in the demo.

(7) /dev/ttyS0 is the main console, /dev/ttyS1 is the debug uart.  Try putting
    some terminal software on that line at 115200kbps and see if you can talk to it.

(8) If you manage to crash this demo (other than (2) above), please send an email 
    to the microblaze uclinux mailing list and tell us how you did it.  Mailing 
    list details found at www.itee.uq/edu.au/~jwilliams/mblaze-uclinux

(9) There is no number 9.

There's still plenty of work to be done, but if you (or your boss) are umm-ing and 
ahh-ing about the viability of uclinux on microblaze, hopefully this demo will 
inspire some confidence.  

Have fun - I certainly am! :)
