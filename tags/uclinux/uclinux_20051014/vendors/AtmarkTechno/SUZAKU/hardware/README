In this directory you will find Xilinx EDK design files to enable 
you to buyild the MBVANILLA hardware target.  MBVANILLA is currently 
the only supported microblaze target.

Investigations are under way to determine the best way to integrate the 
reconfigurable hardware architectures with the linux kernel configuration
process.  If you have any brilliant ideas, I'd love to hear from you.
