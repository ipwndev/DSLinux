This directory contains functions for GMP's floating-point function layer.

In this version of GMP, floating-point numbers are represented like in the
figure below.  (Please note that the format might change between every
version, and that depending on the internal format in any way is a bad idea.)

   most				least
significant		     significant

	 ____ ____ ____ ____ ____
	|____|____|____|____|____|
		       . <------------- radix point

	<------- _mp_size ------->


The most significant limb will be non-zero.  The _mp_exp field is the distance
in number of limbs from the radix point to the most significant limb; it will
be positive iff the absolute value of the number is >= 1.  The _mp_size
field's sign reflects the sign of the number.  Its absolute value is the count
of limbs in the number.
