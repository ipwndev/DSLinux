/* Divide num (NP/NSIZE) by den (DP/DSIZE) and write
   the NSIZE-DSIZE least significant quotient limbs at QP
   and the DSIZE long remainder at NP.  If QEXTRA_LIMBS is
   non-zero, generate that many fraction bits and append them after the
   other quotient limbs.
   Return the most significant limb of the quotient, this is always 0 or 1.

   Preconditions:
   0. NSIZE >= DSIZE.
   1. The most significant bit of the divisor must be set.
   2. QP must either not overlap with the input operands at all, or
      QP + DSIZE >= NP must hold true.  (This means that it's
      possible to put the quotient in the high part of NUM, right after the
      remainder in NUM.
   3. NSIZE >= DSIZE, even if QEXTRA_LIMBS is non-zero.
   4. DSIZE >= 2.  */
