The remote web server seems to be vulnerable to the Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS). The vulnerability is caused
by the result returned to the user when a non-existing file is requested (e.g. the result contains the JavaScript provided
in the request).
The vulnerability would allow an attacker to make the server present the user with the attacker's JavaScript/HTML code.
Since the content is presented by the server, the user will give it the trust
level of the server (for example, the trust level of banks, shopping centers, etc. would usually be high).
