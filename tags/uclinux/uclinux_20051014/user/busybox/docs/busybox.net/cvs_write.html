<h3>CVS Read/Write Access</h3>

If you want to be able to commit things to CVS, first contribute some
stuff to show you are serious.  Then, very nicely ask
<a href="mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik Andersen</a> if he will set you up with
an account.  To access CVS, you will want to add the following to set up your environment:
<pre>
$ export CVS_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
$ export CVSROOT='username@cvs.busybox.net:/var/cvs'</pre>
<br>
It goes without saying you must change <em>username</em> to your own
username...
<p>

To obtain commit access, you will need to demonstrate you are
serious by submitting a few good patches first.  Then, you will need to
select a user-name to use when committing stuff, and finally, you will
need to send me the username you have selected, an ssh key, and the email
address where you prefer email to be sent (I will forward any email sent
to you, but not store it).

<p>
Note that if you would prefer to keep your communications with me
private, you can encrypt your email using my
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/gpg.asc">public key</a>.
