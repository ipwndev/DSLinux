.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Iwlist
is used to display some large chunk of information from a wireless
network interface that is not displayed by iwconfig. This is typically
list of parameters.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.BR freq / channel
Give the list of available frequencies in the device and the number of
defined channels. Please note that usually the driver returns the
total number of channels and only the frequencies available in the
present locale, so there is no one to one mapping between frequencies
displayed and channel numbers.
.TP
.BR scan [ning]
Give the list of Access Points and Ad-Hoc cells in range, and
optionally a whole bunch of information about them (ESSID, Quality,
Frequency, Mode...). The type of information returned depend on what
the card support.
.br
Triggering scanning is a priviledged operation
.RI ( root
only) and normal users can only read letf-over scan results. By
default, the way scanning is done (the scope of the scan) will be
impacted by the current setting of the driver. Also, this command is
supposed to take extra arguments to control the scanning behaviour,
but this is currently not implemented.
.TP
.BR ap / accesspoint / peers
Give the list of Access Points in range, and optionally the quality of
link to them. This feature is obsolte and now deprecated in favor of
scanning support (above), and most drivers don't support it.
.br
Some drivers may use this command to return a specific list of Peers
or Access Points, such as the list of Peers associated/registered with
the card. See your driver documentation for details.
.TP
.BR rate / bit [rate]
List the bit-rates supported by the device.
.TP
.BR key / enc [ryption]
List the encryption key sizes supported and display all the encryption
keys availables in the device.
.TP
.B power
List the various Power Management attributes and modes of the device.
.TP
.B txpower
List the various Transmit Power available on the device.
.TP
.B retry
List the transmit retry limits and retry lifetime on the device.
.TP
.B --version
Display the version of the tools, as well as the recommended and
current Wireless Extensions version for the tool and the various
wireless interfaces.
