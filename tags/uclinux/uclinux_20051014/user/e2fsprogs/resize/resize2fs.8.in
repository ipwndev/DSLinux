.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B resize2fs 
program will resize ext2 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or
shrink an ext2 file system located on
.I device 
so that it will have 
.I size 
blocks.
If the
.I size
parameter is not specified, it will default to the size of the partition.
The 
.I size
parameter may never be larger than the size of the partition.
.PP
The
.B resize2fs
program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge
a filesystem, you must first make sure you can expand the size of the
underlying partition first.  This can be done using 
.BR fdisk (8)
by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size.  When 
recreating the partition, make sure you create it with the same starting
disk cylinder as before!  Otherwise, the resize operation will 
certainly not work, and you may lose your entire filesystem.
.PP
If you wish to shrink the an ext2 partition, first use 
.B resize2fs
to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then you may use 
.BR fdisk (8)
to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of 
the partition, make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size 
of the ext2 filesystem!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-d debug-flags
Turns on various resize2fs debugging features, if they have been compiled 
into the binary.
.I debug-flags
should be computed by adding the numbers of the desired features 
from the following list:
.br
\	1\	\-\ Print out all disk I/O 
.br
\	2\	\-\ Debug block relocations
.br
\	8\	\-\ Debug inode relocations
.br
\	16\	\-\ Debug moving the inode table
.TP
.I \-p
Prints out a percentage completion bars for each 
.B resize2fs
operation, so that the user can keep track of what
the program is doing.
.TP 
.I \-f
Forces resize2fs to proceed with the filesystem resize operation, overriding 
some safety checks which resize2fs normally enforces.
.TP
.I \-F
Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only
really useful for doing 
.B resize2fs
time trials.
