Note: if there is several inode or block bitmap blocks
which require relocation, or one part of the inode table
which must be moved, you may wish to try running e2fsck
with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem may lie only
with the primary block group descriptor, and the backup
block group descriptor may be OK.

Inode table for group 0 is not in group.  (block 40000)
