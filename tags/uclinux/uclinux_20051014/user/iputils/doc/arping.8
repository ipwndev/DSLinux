.TH "ARPING" "8" "27 September 2002" "iputils-020927" "System Manager's Manual: iputils"
.SH NAME
arping \- send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBarping\fR [ \fB-AbDfhqUV\fR]  [ \fB-c \fIcount\fB\fR]  [ \fB-w \fIdeadline\fB\fR]  [ \fB-s \fIsource\fB\fR]  \fB-I \fIinterface\fB\fR \fB\fIdestination\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Ping \fIdestination\fR on device \fIinterface\fR by ARP packets,
using source address \fIsource\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-A\fR
The same as \fB-U\fR, but ARP REPLY packets used instead
of ARP REQUEST.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Send only MAC level broadcasts. Normally \fBarping\fR starts
from sending broadcast, and switch to unicast after reply received.
.TP
\fB-c \fIcount\fB\fR
Stop after sending \fIcount\fR ARP REQUEST
packets. With 
\fIdeadline\fR
option, \fBarping\fR waits for
\fIcount\fR ARP REPLY packets, until the timeout expires.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). See 
RFC2131, 4.4.1.
Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies are received
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Finish after the first reply confirming that target is alive.
.TP
\fB-I \fIinterface\fB\fR
Name of network device where to send ARP REQUEST packets. This option
is required.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print help page and exit.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsource\fB\fR
IP source address to use in ARP packets.
If this option is absent, source address is:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
In DAD mode (with option \fB-D\fR) set to 0.0.0.0.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options \fB-U\fR or \fB-A\fR)
set to \fIdestination\fR.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Otherwise, it is calculated from routing tables.
.RE
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours' ARP caches.
No replies are expected.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Print version of the program and exit.
.TP
\fB-w \fIdeadline\fB\fR
Specify a timeout, in seconds, before
\fBarping\fR
exits regardless of how many
packets have been sent or received. In this case
\fBarping\fR
does not stop after
\fIcount\fR
packet are sent, it waits either for
\fIdeadline\fR
expire or until
\fIcount\fR
probes are answered.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBarping\fR was written by
Alexey Kuznetsov
<kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
\fBarping\fR requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability
to be executed. It is not recommended to be used as set-uid root,
because it allows user to modify ARP caches of neighbour hosts.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fBarping\fR is part of \fIiputils\fR package
and the latest versions are  available in source form for anonymous ftp
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz.
