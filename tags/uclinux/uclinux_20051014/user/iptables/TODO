TODO List for netfilter / iptables. 
Currently maintained by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

Please inform me, if you want to work on any of the TODO items, so I
can update this list and thus prevent two people doing the same work.

CVS ID: $Id$

IMPORTANT issues:
- erroneously too-fast dropped conntrack for half-open TCP connections [JK]
- --mac-source not working in FORWARD (manpage bug?) [BZ]
- locally bound udp port can still be used for MASQ/SNAT [BZ]
- unaligned access of nulldevname during string match [BZ]
- unaligned access in interface match (ip_tables core)
- update documentation to reflect newnat
- release iptables-1.3.0-test (with new libiptc for speedup)
- ipv6 ldp (igmp) and ndisc bypasses LOCAL_OUT hook

TO BE INVESTIGATED:
- packet counters on sparc64 platform [BZ]
- conntrack helper not called for first packet (udp!)
- different behaviour for first packet towards an l2-unresolved ip?

NICE to have:
- sysctl support for ftp-multi, irc-conntrack/nat, ftp-fxp [BZ]
- port conntrack to IPv6 (code reuse?) 
- ip_nat_ident module [BZ]
- make iptables / ip6tables use the same codebase (as libiptc) [KA]
- libipq reentrancy [JM]
- compiling without O2 issue [BZ]
- libipq runtime version, do before 1.2.5 [JM]
- l3 independent ip_queue / ULOG (2.6)
- add support for IRC tracking in opposite direction
- Find mirrors for www.TLD.netfilter.org domains
- example section on homepage
- searchable mailinglist archives
- faq-o-matic system

FUTURE extensions:
- dealing with fragmented expectation-causes (i.e. DCC chat split
  over two packets, etc.)
- conntrack / nat failover [HW]
- unified nfnetlink for queue,ulog,conntrack (and more?) (2.5 issue)

Userspace queuing for 2.5:
- Integration with nfnetlink.
- Multiple queues per protocol.
- Netlink broadcast support.
- Allow multiple reader/writers in userspace.
- How to handle multiple protocols (e.g. use separate queue handlers
  or a multiplexer like ipqmpd).
- Peformance improvements: multipart messages, mmaped socket (possibly).
- Simplify queuing logic, which is quite ugly at the moment. (BC suggested
  removing logic from kernel).
- Allow userspace to set nfmark.
- Allow userspace to set queue length etc.
- Possibly pass conntrack/NAT info to userspace with packet.
