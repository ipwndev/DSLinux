This directory contains patches for adding Host AP driver to various
versions of Linux kernel from kernel.org. The patch file contains only
minimal changes to the existing kernel distribution files. It should
thus be easy to update for new kernel versions. In addition, source
code for the Host AP driver, i.e., driver/modules/hostap*.[ch], needs
to be copied to Linux kernel's directory drivers/net/wireless.

Example commands for patching a kernel release from kernel.org:

cd linux
patch -p1 < ../hostap/kernel-patches/hostap-linux-2.4.20.patch
cp ../hostap/driver/modules/hostap*.[ch] drivers/net/wireless

Kernel configuration options for Host AP are in Network device support
/ Wireless LAN (non-hamradio). You will need to select both the common
code "Host AP support .." and the hardware model specific drivers
"Host AP driver ..".
