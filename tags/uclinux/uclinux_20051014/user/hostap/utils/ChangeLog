ChangeLog for Host AP utils

2004-07-17 - v0.2.4 (beginning of 0.2.x stable releases)
	* no changes since 0.2.1

2004-05-06 - v0.2.1
	* hostap_rid: fixed handling of failed RID reads

2004-02-15 - v0.2.0
	* fixed prism2_srec not to allow combination of volatile and
	  non-volatile firmware images (they will corrupt the card flash)
	* added support for loading PRI firmware for cards without PRI in
	  flash (new prism2_srec command line option, -s, for skipping PDA
	  read since PDA is not available without PRI firmware)
	* added example script, hostap_fw_load, to demonstrate how firmware
	  images can be loaded automatically based on what images are
	  available in card flash; this script includes commands needed to
	  initialize cards without PRI image in flash (like D-Link DWL-650
	  rev. P1 and D-Link DWL-520 rev. E1
	* fixed volatile download of combined primary and secondary firmware
	  to start running the secondary firmware
	* added support for dumping PDA in text format and overriding PDA
	  with text and binary files (prism2_srec options -D, -P, and -O)


Note:

Older changes up to and including v0.1.0 are included in the ChangeLog
of the Host AP driver.
