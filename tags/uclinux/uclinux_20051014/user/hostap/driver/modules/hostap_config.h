 * The driver code for implementing bus master support is based on guessing
 * and experimenting suitable control bits and these might not be correct.
 * This code is included because using bus master makes a huge difference in
 * host CPU load (something like 40% host CPU usage to 5-10% when sending or
 * receiving at maximum throughput).
 *
 * Note2! Station firmware version 1.3.5 and primary firmware version 1.0.7
 * have some fixes for PCI corruption and these (or newer) versions are
 * recommended especially when using bus mastering.
 *
 * NOTE: PCI bus mastering code has not been updated for long time and it is
 * not likely to compile and it will _not_ work as is. Only enable this if you
 * are prepared to first fix the implementation..
