.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR [filename] | \-fd\ [n] | \-help | \-version | \-sockets
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBstunnel\fR program is designed to work as \fI\s-1SSL\s0\fR encryption wrapper 
between remote clients and local (\fIinetd\fR\-startable) or remote
servers. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on
your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over
secure \s-1SSL\s0 channels.
.PP
\&\fBstunnel\fR can be used to add \s-1SSL\s0 functionality to commonly used \fIInetd\fR
daemons like \s-1POP\-2\s0, \s-1POP\-3\s0, and \s-1IMAP\s0 servers, to standalone daemons like
\&\s-1NNTP\s0, \s-1SMTP\s0 and \s-1HTTP\s0, and in tunneling \s-1PPP\s0 over network sockets without
changes to the source code.

.Sh "\s-1GLOBAL\s0 \s-1OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fBCApath\fR = directory" 4
.IX Item "CApath = directory"
Certificate Authority directory
.Sp
This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for certificates when
using the \fIverify\fR. Note that the certificates in this directory
should be named \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0.0 where \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0 is the hash value of the cert.
.IP "\fBCAfile\fR = certfile" 4
.IX Item "CAfile = certfile"
Certificate Authority file
.Sp
This file contains multiple \s-1CA\s0 certificates, used with the \fIverify\fR.
.IP "\fBcert\fR = pemfile" 4
.IX Item "cert = pemfile"
certificate chain \s-1PEM\s0 file name
.Sp
A \s-1PEM\s0 is always needed in server mode.
Specifying this flag in client mode will use this certificate chain
as a client side certificate chain.  Using client side certs is optional.
The certificates must be in \s-1PEM\s0 format and must be sorted starting with the
certificate to the highest level (root \s-1CA\s0).
.IP "\fBchroot\fR = directory (Unix only)" 4
.IX Item "chroot = directory (Unix only)"
directory to chroot \fBstunnel\fR process
.Sp
\&\fBchroot\fR keeps \fBstunnel\fR in chrooted jail.  \fICApath\fR, \fIpid\fR and \fIexec\fR
are located inside the jail and the patches have to be relative to the
directory specified with \fBchroot\fR.
.Sp
To have libwrap (\s-1TCP\s0 Wrappers) control effective in a chrooted environment
you also have to copy its configuration files (/etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny) there.
.IP "\fBciphers\fR = cipherlist" 4
.IX Item "ciphers = cipherlist"
Select permitted \s-1SSL\s0 ciphers

.Sp
default: no (server mode)
.IP "\fBCRLpath\fR = directory" 4
.IX Item "CRLpath = directory"
Certificate Revocation Lists directory
.Sp
This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for CRLs when
using the \fIverify\fR. Note that the CRLs in this directory should
be named \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0.0 where \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0 is the hash value of the \s-1CRL\s0.
.IP "\fBCRLfile\fR = certfile" 4
.IX Item "CRLfile = certfile"
Certificate Revocation Lists file
.Sp
This file contains multiple CRLs, used with the \fIverify\fR.
.IP "\fBdebug\fR = [facility.]level" 4
.IX Item "debug = [facility.]level"
debugging level
.Sp
Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers
emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5),
info (6), or debug (7).  All logs for the specified level and
all levels numerically less than it will be shown.  Use \fBdebug = debug\fR or
\&\fBdebug = 7\fR for greatest debugging output.  The default is notice (5).
.Sp
The syslog facility 'daemon' will be used unless a facility name is supplied.
(Facilities are not supported on Win32.)
.Sp
Case is ignored for both facilities and levels.
.IP "\fB\s-1EGD\s0\fR = egd path (Unix only)" 4
.IX Item "EGD = egd path (Unix only)"
path to Entropy Gathering Daemon socket
.Sp

.Sp
Stay in foreground (don't fork) and log to stderr
instead of via syslog (unless \fBoutput\fR is specified).
.Sp
default: background in daemon mode
.IP "\fBkey\fR = keyfile" 4
.IX Item "key = keyfile"
private key for certificate specified with \fIcert\fR option
.Sp
Private key is needed to authenticate certificate owner.
Since this file should be kept secret it should only be readable
to its owner.  On Unix systems you can use the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    chmod 600 keyfile
.Ve
default: value of \fIcert\fR option
.IP "\fBoptions\fR = SSL_options" 4
.IX Item "options = SSL_options"
OpenSSL library options
.Sp
The parameter is the OpenSSL option name as described in the
\&\fI\fISSL_CTX_set_options\fI\|(3ssl)\fR manual, but without \fI\s-1SSL_OP_\s0\fR prefix.
Several \fIoptions\fR can be used to specify multiple options.
.Sp
For example for compatibility with erroneous Eudora \s-1SSL\s0 implementation
the following option can be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
.Ve
.IP "\fBoutput\fR = file" 4
.IX Item "output = file"
append log messages to a file instead of using syslog

.IX Header "RESTRICTIONS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR cannot be used for the \s-1FTP\s0 daemon because of the nature
of the \s-1FTP\s0 protocol which utilizes multiple ports for data transfers.
There are available \s-1SSL\s0 enabled versions of \s-1FTP\s0 and telnet daemons, however.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.Sh "\s-1INETD\s0 \s-1MODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "INETD MODE"
The most common use of \fBstunnel\fR is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port
via the connect option, or a new program via the \fIexec\fR option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have
some other program accept incoming connections and
launch \fBstunnel\fR, for example with \fIinetd\fR, \fIxinetd\fR,
or \fItcpserver\fR.
.PP
For example, if you have the following line in \fIinetd.conf\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/stunnel stunnel /etc/stunnel/imaps.conf
.Ve
In these cases, the \fIinetd\fR\-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (\fIimaps\fR above) and handing
it to \fBstunnel\fR when a connection is received.
Thus you do not want \fBstunnel\fR to have any \fIaccept\fR option.
All the \fIService Level Options\fR should be placed in the
global options section, and no \fI[service_name]\fR section
will be present.  See the \fI\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\fR section for example
configurations.
.Sh "\s-1CERTIFICATES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CERTIFICATES"
Each \s-1SSL\s0 enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate
to the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming
data. The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to 
generate them with the free \fIOpenSSL\fR package. You can find more
information on certificates generation on pages listed below.
.PP
Two things are important when generating certificate-key pairs for
\&\fBstunnel\fR. The private key cannot be encrypted, because the server
has no way to obtain the password from the user. To produce an
unencrypted key add the \fI\-nodes\fR option when running the \fBreq\fR
command from the \fIOpenSSL\fR kit.
.PP
The order of contents of the \fI.pem\fR file is also important.
It should contain the unencrypted private key first, then a signed certificate
(not certificate request).
There should be also empty lines after certificate and private key.
Plaintext certificate information appended on the top of generated certificate
should be discarded. So the file should look like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
\&    [encoded key]
\&    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
\&    [empty line]
\&    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
\&    [encoded certificate]
\&    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
\&    [empty line]
.Ve
.Sh "\s-1RANDOMNESS\s0"
.IX Subsection "RANDOMNESS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR needs to seed the \s-1PRNG\s0 (pseudo random number generator) in
order for \s-1SSL\s0 to use good randomness.  The following sources are loaded
in order until sufficient random data has been gathered:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified by the \s-1RANDFILE\s0 environment variable, if set.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file .rnd in your home directory, if \s-1RANDFILE\s0 not set.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified with '\-\-with\-random' at compile time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The contents of the screen if running on Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The egd socket specified with the \fI\s-1EGD\s0\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The egd socket specified with '\-\-with\-egd\-sock' at compile time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The /dev/urandom device.
.PP
With recent (>=OpenSSL 0.9.5a) version of \s-1SSL\s0 it will stop loading
random data automatically when sufficient entropy has been gathered.
With previous versions it will continue to gather from all the above
sources since no \s-1SSL\s0 function exists to tell when enough data is available.
.PP
Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction
(mouse movements, creating windows, etc) the screen contents are not
variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a random file
for use with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.PP
Note that the file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag should contain
random data \*(-- that means it should contain different information
each time \fBstunnel\fR is run.  This is handled automatically
unless the \fIRNDoverwrite\fR flag is used.  If you wish to update this file
manually, the \fIopenssl rand\fR command in recent versions of OpenSSL,
would be useful.
.PP
One important note \*(-- if /dev/urandom is available, OpenSSL has a habit of
seeding the \s-1PRNG\s0 with it even when checking the random state, so on
systems with /dev/urandom you're likely to use it even though it's listed
at the very bottom of the list above.  This isn't \fBstunnel's\fR behaviour, it's
OpenSSLs.
