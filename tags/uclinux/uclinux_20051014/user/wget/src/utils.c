   errors.  If there is not enough virtual memory for running Wget,
   something is seriously wrong, and Wget exits with an appropriate
   error message.

   The second reason why these are useful is that, if DEBUG_MALLOC is

/* These functions end with _real because they need to be

     #define xrealloc xrealloc_real
     #define xstrdup xstrdup_real
     #define xfree free

   In case of memory debugging, the definitions are a bit more
   complex, because we want to provide more information, *and* we want
   to call the debugging code.  (The former is the reason why xmalloc
   and friends need to be macros in the first place.)  Then it looks
   like this:

     #define xmalloc(a) xmalloc_debug (a, __FILE__, __LINE__)
     #define xfree(a)   xfree_debug (a, __FILE__, __LINE__)
     #define xrealloc(a, b) xrealloc_debug (a, b, __FILE__, __LINE__)
     #define xstrdup(a) xstrdup_debug (a, __FILE__, __LINE__)

   This works by setting up SIGALRM to be delivered in TIMEOUT seconds
   using setitimer() or alarm().  The timeout is enforced by
   longjumping out of the SIGALRM handler.  This has several
   advantages compared to the traditional approach of relying on
   signals causing system calls to exit with EINTR:

     * The callback function is *forcibly* interrupted after the
       timeout expires, (almost) regardless of what it was doing and
       whether it was in a syscall.  For example, a calculation that
       takes a long time is interrupted as reliably as an IO
       operation.

     * It works with both SYSV and BSD signals because it doesn't
       depend on the default setting of SA_RESTART.

     * It doesn't special handler setup beyond a simple call to
       signal().  (It does use sigsetjmp/siglongjmp, but they're
       optional.)

   The only downside is that, if FUN allocates internal resources that
   are normally freed prior to exit from the functions, they will be
   lost in case of timeout.  */
