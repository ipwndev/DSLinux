#
# This script creates a Wget distribution (wget-VERSION.tar.gz).
# It uses `make dist' to do most of the work, but corrects some
# things that `make dist' doesn't and can't do.  Specifically:
#
# * Checks out the clean CVS source from the repository to a temporary
#   directory.
# * Runs autoconf, configure and `make' in the doc and po subdirs to
#   make sure that all the generated files, such as `confifure',
#   `wget.info', and translated PO files, end up in the distribution.
# * Optionally changes src/version.c and doc/version.texi to the
#   version forced by `--force-version'.
# * Runs `make dist' to produce the archive.
# * Removes the checkout.
#
# For example, to produce a Wget beta based on the latest CVS sources,
# with version "1.23-beta10", run `dist-wget --force-version 1.23-beta10'.
# You can choose which sources will be used by specifying `-D DATE'
# or `-r TAG'.
