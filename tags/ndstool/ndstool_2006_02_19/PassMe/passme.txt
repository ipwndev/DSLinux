PassMe is a piece of hardware for patching Nintendo DS cartridge transfers which allows running homebrew code from GBA cartridge.
Proof-of-concept using FPGA, CRC16 implementation (now left out again for new firmwares) by DarkFader. http://darkfader.net/ds/
PassMe name and board design by Natrium42. http://www.dslinux.org/blogs/natrium42
PassMe2 name sucks and refers to this newer compatibility method.
SRAM code for compatibility for new firmwares by Loopy.

To generate PassMe VHDL code based on a romdump:
	ndstool -p gamedump.nds passme.vhd passme.sav

Xilinx:
	Tested with Xilinx XC9572XL-VQ44.
	Example project files are included.
	Generate jedec programming file with Xilinx ISE and program CPLD using iMPACT program.

Write FlashMe.nds or something else to GBA flashcartridge.
Write savegame file to SRAM of flahcartridge.
Boot DS.
