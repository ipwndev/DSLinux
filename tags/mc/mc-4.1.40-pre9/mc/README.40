About:
~~~~~~
The goal of this project is creating a stable, well-working, usefull 
console-only version of well-known Midnight Commander, without bugs 
and garbage, like tk, xv and gnome. 

I'm bored waiting for bugfixes, and A'rpi's ESP team stops their work in 
this direction too, so I did it. I'm fixing all (found) bugs, reported by my 
friends, and made some really pleasent new features, like real-time clock, 
or filegroups colorizing.

- Why is it an alternate version of mc, instead applying patches
to main mc project? 

- The original mc is now about v4.6.x, with more and more bugs, 
"monster from the console" grows more and more, and now it has some 
very bad structural changes, tons of garbage code, and finally - 
there is no possibilities to compile it without some X parts, like Glib
(that is support-library for GTK+).

When I use linux - i want to use fast and powerfull _console_ file manager, 
and I like mc 4.1.x series much better: it has well-designed structures, 
easy to add new features.

Btw. I back-ported some of new usefull things appeared in 4.5.x and 4.6.x, 
make some fixes, catch some memory leaks, and so on...


Quick installation:   (keep this order!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1.	Check/edit mc.configure, and execute it:
	    ./mc.configure
        (remove --without-gpm-mouse for console mouse support)
	You can also use ./configure, specifying options manually.
    NOTE:
        You can use "mc-[SYSTEM_CLASS_NAME].configure" scripts for 
	different systems, if you can't or wan't read simple "./configure 
	--help", and/or can't combine some necessary commandline keys 
	of "configure" in conclusion.

    2.	Compile it:
    	    make

    3.	If compilation successful, remove your old mc version, because it
        DOES CONFLICT with this. At least delete everything from /usr/lib/mc:
	    rm -rf /usr/lib/mc ~/.mc

    4.  Install the new mc:
	    make install


ToDo:
~~~~~
	- moved to separate "TODO" [ -> README.TODO.40 ] file.

New features in 4.1.40-pre9:    (Metal is forever!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    General:
	- ADDED: EXTFS patches from Hatred: 
		 * New EXTFS behaviour: strings from Miguel's "url" format:
		   "rpm:cpio:/path/ar.rpm/ar.cpio/path2" 
		   converted to strings in "#proski/" format, at form:
		   "/path/ar.rpm#rpm/ar.cpio#cpio/path2"

		!!! Warning: Looks buggy (don't enter archives from simple user), 
		    if user not delete previos MC init file. Don't fear. ;)

	- ADDED: EXTFS mkdir/rmdir/unlink features for archives, EXPERIMENTAL!
	- ADDED: Some new keybindings: 
		 * CTRL+` - "toggle bookmark" in editor
		 * ALT+INS - "Paste from clipboard" in editor (as Sh-INS)
		 * Ctrl+LEFT, Ctrl+RIGHT - fast horizontal movement (10 chars)
		   in Viewer
	- ADDED: "External Scripting" function in Editor. Thanx to Gergely
		 Szasz for original idea.
	- ADDED: "CD-recording" into PowerPack. Thanx to Bart Friederichs for 
		  original realisation. But it's incomplete, and WET yet!
	- ADDED: "Double frames" feature and option for panels, EXPERIMENTAL!
		 Possibly will work only with PC/KOI 8bit character mappings
	- ADDED: "Show mountpoint info" feature and option for panels:
		 * Shows [ FreeSize / TotalSize ] on panel's bottom for current 
		   mountpoint
	- ADDED: "Panel Scrollbar" option for panels: shows scrollbar
	- ADDED: "Fullscreen mode" for Viewer, which binded on F11 fkey:
		 * very useful for ebook-reading process on PDAs and notebooks
		   with small screen: statusline and keybar dissapoints reader 
		   person because useful text smaller on two lines.
	- CHANGED: "Layout" dialog:
		 * Added options - "Double frames", "Panel Scrollbar", "Show 
		   mountpoint info"
		 * Added "l&Ynx-like motion" option, moved from "Configuration"
		 * Re-layed some elemenths of "Layout" dialog
	- CHANGED: panel menu for mountpoints rewritten from scratch:
		 * now we has possibility to show: mountpoint name, size of 
		   FS at mountpoint, free space, mounted device name, full 
		   path on mountpoint (from panel's history) and HotKeys. 
		   Work will be continued. FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL!
		 * "mc_cd_mountpoint_and_dir" setup option: allow to CD into
		   last used directory of selected MountPoint. INI option, off
		   by default.

		!!! Warning: Needs BeOS and QNX FIXES! Code revision requered.

	- CHANGED: "Enter" key behaviour for Viewer: now scroll text by page, 
		   nor line:
		 * very useful for ebook-reading process on PDAs and notebooks, 
		   where is absent PgUP and PgDN keys: BkSPC and Enter are 
		   changing them.
	- FIXED: Some security fixes applied, some memleaks catched
	- FIXED: 2GB limit in directory size counters not has a place anymore

		!!! Warning: Possible bugs! Needs more code revision.

	- FIXED: With native SLANG compilation problem connected with placement
		 of nice rotating dash.
	- FIXED: Single search-string buffer for all search/replace ops
	- FIXED: Duplicates in all historys unnecessary and must be off!
	- FIXED: Menubar now has HotKeys highlights
	- FIXED: Listbox now has HotKeys (when exist) showing with highlights.
	- REMOVED: (temporaly, I hope) all ".po" files, except "ru.po". 
		   Maintainer waits for your suggestions about your locales.

	         dialog (which binded on "Ctrl+x a")
	- ADDED: "Free all VFS now" feature in "Commands" menu
	- ADDED: "find First entry only" feature in "Find File" dialog. This 
		 option gave possibility to find only first entry of searching 
		 text definition, one per file
	- ADDED: initial support of MultiScreen feature (thanx a lot to 
	         Walery Studennikov for idea, primal MC realisation and help 
		 in porting to mc-MP)
		 Keybindings for this feature are next (for both panels and 
		 editor):
		  * Alt+d - "Dialogs" menu  (This keybinding is TEMPLATE and 
		    must be changed as soon as possible)
		  * Alt+i - "Next Dialog"
		  * Alt+u - "Previous Dialog"
	- ADDED: "HotKeys filesort" feature and keybindings (Ctrl+x 1,2,3,...,7)

		 indicator feature (that shows current sorting state ) is also 
		 realized
	- ADDED: "Charsets" additional keybinding [Shift-F8] (for editor)
    	- IMPROVED: BeOS support (PE5/Dan0 +BONE, thanx to Smedos for help)

	            if cmdline buffer is clear
    	- IMPROVED: Ctrl+H behaviour is changed:
		    * IF cmdline buffer is clear - Ctrl+H Shows/Hides hidden 
		      files/dirs, else Ctrl+H works as BackSpace
	- FIXED: SunOS/Solaris support (thanx to Mikhail Yu. Fursov for 
	         Solaris's "strsep"=="getToken" analogy) 

	        * SOLARIS PORT TESTED WITH GCC ONLY!

	- FIXED: editor behaviour with search in "re-encoding" mode
	- FIXED: editor statusline info shorts, when clock display is on 
	         (useful for 80x25 mode, but can be reverted to an older view)
	- FIXED: editor bookmarks shows correctly with [n]curses
	- FIXED: viewer's hex editor correctly shows cursor colors with [n]curses

	        * possible need some colour-corrections for slang/xterm mode
		
	- FIXED: viewer's hex editor "offset marks" currently has 8 chars, that
	         revert old-style "5-chars marks" for correction of indecorous 
		 figure, "inheritance" of older MCs
	- FIXED: viewer's status line dynamicly follows long of i18n string 
	         values (including "Col:", "Offset:", "File:", "bytes", and so 
		 on)

    Scripts:
        - Added some "mc-[SYSTEM_CLASS_NAME].configure" scripts for 
	  different systems: for most impatient persons, who can't read 
	  simple "./configure --help", and/or can't combine some necessary 
	  commandline keys of "configure" in conclusion.
	- audio vfs partially reworked
