TODO

- Make most files common for OS/2 and NT
- Move settings from mc.ini to the registry for Windows NT/95 (optionally?)
- Fix opendir/readdir d_date and d_time packing (they return 10).
- Fix gettimeofday()
- Write a better stat function than the one RTL gives us. We can provide
user ID (on NT) and rwx permissions.
- Optionally use vfsapi.lib for ext2 filesystems on OS/2
- Write the VFS
- Write a better documentation
- Write a better canonify_pathname()
