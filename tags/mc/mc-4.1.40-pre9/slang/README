This is the Slang Screen Manager, it has been modified a little to
make it work with the Midnight Commander.  If you want to get the
complete Slang distribution, you may grab it from:

space.mit.edu:/pub/davis

All of the patches relevant to Slang have been sumbited to John Davis
for inclusion in his Slang version, changes that are only useful for
the Midnight Commander have not been submited.
