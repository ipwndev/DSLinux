QUERY %|[-window] [-<server tag>] <nick> [<message>]

Starts a private conversation with the nick.  All text you type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to the specified nick in the form of MSGs. 

Usually this command opens up a new window, too.

Note: It removes the active query from the active window when used without parameters, like UNQUERY.
