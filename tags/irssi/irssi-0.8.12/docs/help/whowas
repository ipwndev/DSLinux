WHOWAS %|[<nicks> [<count> [server]]]

This command is similar to WHOIS, except it returns information about nicknames that were recently in use. Like WHOIS, it shows the nickname, address, real name, and server. It may also return multiple entries if the nickname has been used recently by several people. These multiples may be limited by specifying a count to show. 

WHOWAS will work regardless of whether the queried nick is in use. If no arguments are given, the client's current nickname is used. 

Example: To show the last 5 users of the nickname JoeBob: 

/whowas joebob 5
