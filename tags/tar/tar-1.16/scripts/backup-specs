# This is a sample configuration file for GNU tar backup script.
# See end of file for copying conditions

# User name or email address of the administrator of backups. A report
# will be sent to this address when the backup terminates
ADMINISTRATOR="root@localhost"

# (Optional) Path to tar binary.
TAR=/bin/tar

# (Optional) Path to rsh binary or its equivalent. You may wish to
# set it to ssh as shown in the example below, to improve security.
# In this case you will have to use public key authentication.
RSH=/usr/local/bin/ssh

# (Optional) Path to rsh binary on remote mashines. This will be
# passed via --rsh-command option to the remote invocation of
# tar
RSH_COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/ssh

# Name of temporary file to hold volume numbers.  This needs to be accessible
# by all the machines which have filesystems to be dumped.
VOLNO_FILE=/root/volume

# Device to use for dumping.  It should be on the host
# on which the dump scripts are run.
TAPE_FILE=/dev/rmt0

# Blocking factor to use for writing the dump.
BLOCKING=124

# List of file systems to be dumped. If prefixed with a HOST:
# the filesystem is accessed on the given HOST, unless it
# coincides with the local machine name.
# If a file system starts with a slash, it is handled as a local
# one.
BACKUP_DIRS='remote1:/etc remote1:/var/spool/crontab'
# Alternatively, you may leave this variable unassigned, and
# keep the list of filesystems to be dumped in file
# $SYSCONFDIR/backup/dirs, one filesystem per line. Empty
# lines and shell comments are allowed in this file. The location
# of this file may be overridden using DIRLIST variable, e.g.:
# DIRLIST=/etc/my-backup/dirlist

# List of individual files to be dumped.
# These should be accesible from the machine on which the dump is run.
BACKUP_FILES=''
# This list may also be kept in file $SYSCONFDIR/backup/files, the
# format of which is the same as described above. The location of
# this file may be overridden by setting FILELIST variable:
# FILELIST=/etc/my-backup/filelist

# Name of 'exclude file list'. It is searched under $SYSCONFDIR/tar-backup
# on remote machines
XLIST=exclude_files

# Default directory for storing incremental listings on remote
# machines is $SYSCONFDIR/tar-backup. It can be overridden using
# REMOTEBACKUPDIR variable

# Default directory for storing backup logs is $SYSCONFDIR/backup/log.
# It can also be overridden via LOGPATH variable.

# Time to sleep between dumps of any two successive filesystems
SLEEP_TIME=15

# Script to be run when it's time to insert a new tape in for the next
# volume.  Administrators may want to tailor this script for their site. 
# If this variable isn't set, tar will use some default behavior which is
# probably defined in the manual. 
#DUMP_REMIND_SCRIPT='rsh apple-gunkies /home/gd2/dump/dump-remind'

# Message to display on the terminal while waiting for dump time.  Usually
# this will just be some literal text, preferably something more
# entertaining than this.  The awk script here saves some redundant
# repetition, but is not really all that desirable.
SLEEP_MESSAGE="`awk '
   BEGIN {
