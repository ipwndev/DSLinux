# Using tar 1.15.x the following equivalent command sets:
#
#   1. tar cf archive file1 file2 
# and
#   2. tar cfT archive /dev/null
#      tar rf archive file1
#      tar rt archive file2
#
# produced different archives (GNU format is assumed).  Namely, in the
# second case the mode field of all members, except the first, was truncated
# to lower 3 octets (& 0777).
