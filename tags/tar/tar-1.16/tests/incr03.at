# Description:
# Previous versions checked only mtime/ctime of directories during
# incremental backups.  As a result, it sufficed to rename a single file
# to get full dump of the directory where it resided.  Since v.1.15.91
# tar checks directory contents as well, so in this case only the renamed
# file is dumped.
