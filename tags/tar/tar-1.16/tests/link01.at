# Problem: If a member with link count > 2 was stored in the archive twice,
# previous versions of tar were not able to extract it, since they
# were trying to link the file to itself, which always failed and
# lead to removing the already extracted copy. This script tests
# the workaround by Paul Eggert that leaves the extracted copy
# untouched.
