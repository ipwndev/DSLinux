# Problem: Tar was not able to match directory name if the directory
# member was split between two volumes
# References: JÃ¶rg Schilling pretends to have reported this two
# years ago (<42551FF2.nail98011FRAT@burner>).

# Test idea:
# 1. Create a listed-incremental archive of a directory containing
# a cetrain number of zero-length files.
# 2. Using the same snapshot file, create a *multivolume* listed-incremental
# archive. Number of files created in the directory and volume size should
# be selected so that the first volume ends in the midst of the directory
# member. The files are zero-length so that their member records are
# sufficiently small, in order for the entire archive to fit in two volumes.
# 3. Test the created multi-volume archive.
