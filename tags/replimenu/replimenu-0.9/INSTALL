                                INSTALLATION

	1) Read/modify the "configuration" file.

        2) Type "make" to compile a dynamically linked executable, or type
           "make DOSTATIC=true" to compile a statically linked executable.

        3) To install replimenu, type "make install" or...
           "make PREFIX=/usr install" to install it under /usr/bin and
           /usr/man/man1 instead of /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1.

           To only install the binary, just copy src/replimenu anywhere you
           choose.

	4) That's it.
