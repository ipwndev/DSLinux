        * Version 0.9.991 released.
	
	* play.c, record.c, move_au.c, move_fd.c: Fixed bug which caused
	root permissions to be dropped before all threads were created.

2006-1-10  Britton Leo Kerin <rawrec@letterboxes.org>
	
	* main.c: fixed command line help output, fixed problem when
	program invoked by full path name.

2002-11-28  Britton Leo Kerin  <fsblk@uaf.edu>

        * Version 0.9.98 released.
	
	* main.c: basename() is no longer used at all.  

	* play.c, record.c, ringbuf_init.c: Accounted for fact that POSIX
	defines for MEMLOCK can be magic numbers meaning features are not
	available or need a runtime check.  Accounted for fact that libc
	doesn't seem to set these symbols exactly as specified by the
	standard.  

	* Makefile: Added commented out variable which can define a
	preprocessor symbol to enable some fancy thread responsiveness
	features.

        * docs/user/rawrec.1: Updated to include information on signal
	handling and buffer overflow behavior.
	
	* src/Makefile (bin_install): Now correctly depends on $(PROG),

	anything on other archs yet.

        * src/move_au.c (move_au): When recording, move_au now aborts the
	entire program if a trylock on a segment fails (if it finds itself
	waiting on move_fd).

	* Added special shutdown processing for SIGTERM.  Involved adding
	shutdown_signal_seen and tell_main_follower_done flags and
	associated mutex awareness to play, record, move_au, move_fd, and
	term_handler.  
	* New file: src/shutdown_signal_handler.c. Contains a handler
	function which allows us to perform clean shutdown on SIGTERM.
	Mechanism should work fine for other signals as well, but
	currently only SIGTERM and SIGINT get special treatment.

	with or without root permissions

	* src/write_silence_on_option.c (write_silence_on_option): error
	checking on all mallocs
	
	* src/move_fd.c (move_fd): added wait on condition variable
	wrap_ready_cv to prevent buffer wrap around before second thread
	started

	* src/ringbuf_init.c (ringbuf_init): code to determine seg_cnt now
	insists on at least three segments (so staggered locking works
	right)
	
	* src/main.c (main): changed format of long option names to hyphen
	seperated words, rather than underscore seperated words	
	* src/usage.c (usage): changed output to reflect new option name
	format

	FOR_WRITING instead of incorrect FOR_READING

2000-08-17  Britton Leo Kerin  <fsblk@aurora.alaska.edu>

	* Version 0.9.9 released

	* src/process_command_line.c (process_command_line): added case to
	handle setting of sample limit when a filename is given to rawplay
	without a time limit.

	* src/process_command_line.c (process_command_line): when a limit
	gets set, then ap.time_limit_set and ap.samp_limit_set also get
	set as appropriate (except when the limit is a bogus maximum of a
	type).

2000-08-04  Britton Leo Kerin  <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu>

	* src/Makefile (bin_install): added suid warning

2000-08-03  Britton Leo Kerin  <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu>
