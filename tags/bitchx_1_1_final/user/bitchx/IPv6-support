  ./configure --enable-ipv6

supported platforms
  linux with glibc (tested on redhat with glibc 2.1.1 and 2.2.x kernels)
  linux with libinet6 (untested)
  freebsd with kame (tested on freebsd 3.4)

virtual hosts
  they work only under linux (will anyone tell me how to get IPv6 addrs
  under freebsd?). ifconfig is used to determine IP addrs, so you need
  to recompile your net-tools package with INET6 address family support.

  from now on you can use `-norev' parameter in `/irchost' to turn off
  name resolving, because it sometimes is veeery looong :)

command line and `/server'
  their parameters are delimited with a colon, just like 16-bit words in
  IPv6 addrs. so now you can also use a comma instead of `:'. for example,
  both `/server dead::beef' and `/server dead::beef:6667' won't do, because
  BitchX will try to connect to server `dead' with password `beef'. instead
  use `/server dead::beef,' (note the comma) and `/server dead::beef,6667'.
  the same rule applies to command line parameters.

dcc stuff
  only v4 dcc is supported. ctcp/2 is much too complicated for me :) if you
  want to use IPv6 virtual hosts and still be able to initiate dcc, you need
  to set NAT_ADDRESS to any of your IPv4 addrs.
