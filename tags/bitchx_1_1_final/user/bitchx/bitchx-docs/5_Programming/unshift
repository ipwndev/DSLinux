Synopsis:
   unshift <variable name> <word>
   shift   <variable name>

Description:
   UNSHIFT prepends the given word (or words) to the given variable,
   padded with a single space.  The variable name itself may not contain
   a leading '$'; the command uses the variable itself, not the expanded
   contents.  If the variable does not exist, it is created containing
   the given word(s) (just as if ASSIGN were used).

Aliases:
   SHIFT is the exact opposite of UNSHIFT, in that it chops off the first
   word in the variable.  If there is only one word in the variable, the
   variable is deleted.  Both UNSHIFT and SHIFT are functionally equivalent
   to the $unshift() and $shift() functions, respectively.
