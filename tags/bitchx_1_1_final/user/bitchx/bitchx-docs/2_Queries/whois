Synopsis:
   whois [<server|nickname>] [<nickname>[,<nickname>[,...]]]

Description:
   The WHOIS command is used to retrieve moderately detailed information
   about the nickname(s) specified.  This will always include the user's
   nickname, address (user@hostname), real name (IRCNAME), and the server
   that user is on.  It may also show what channels the user is on (if
   any, and if they aren't +p/+s) and whether the user is +o/+v in any of
   those channels, whether the user is away, and if the user is an irc
   operator.

   WHOIS may be used on multiple nicknames at once, provided they are
   delimited with commas.  If a server name is specified, that server will
   be queried instead of the client's current server.  If no arguments are
   given, the WHOIS will be performed on the client itself.

   The command can also display the queried user's idle time (amount of
   time since the client last did anything on the server).  This is only
   displayed if the user is on the same server as the client, or if the
   user's server is queried.  When querying for idle time, a single
   nickname may be given in place of a server, in which case that user's
   server will be queried.

Examples:
   To get information on users JoeBob, ToeJam, and JuneBug:
      /whois joebob,toejam,junebug

   To get information on the same people from server irc.foo.com:
      /whois irc.foo.com joebob,toejam,junebug

   To get the idle time for user JoeBob:
      /whois joebob joebob

   who(2); whowas(2)

Restrictions:
   In WHOIS output, only channels that are not +p or +s are shown, unless
   the client happens to be on one of those channels.

Other Notes:
   In addition to idle time, some servers also return the time the user
   signed on to irc.

   If you query a remote server for WHOIS information, there is no reliable
   way to "wait" for the data to come back (i.e. WAIT will be useless).
