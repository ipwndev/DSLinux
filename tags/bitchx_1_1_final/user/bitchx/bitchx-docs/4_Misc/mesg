Synopsis:
   mesg [yes|no]

Description:
   This command works exactly like the Unix command of the same name.  It
   effectively removes the world-write permissions on the client's tty,
   such that incoming talk requests and writes are blocked.  It is most
   useful for dodging "flash" bombs; talk requests with special escape
   sequences in the username that scramble vt100 terminals.

   MESG used with no arguments displays the current setting.

Other Notes:
   This command has the undesired side effect of blocking legitimate talk
   requests.  Talk and write are not blocked, however, when sent from the
   host's superuser.
