Synopsis:
   window server [-ssl] <server>[:[<port>][:[<password>][:[<nickname>]]]]

Description:
   This command works in a similar manner as the SERVER command, except
   the new server only applies to the current window.  This provides a
   convenient mechanism for being on multiple servers at once.

   The server name is the only required argument.  Any or all of the other
   may be specified as desired, however a colon must separate each
   argument, even if one is missing (see the examples below).

Examples:
   To connect to server irc.foo.com on port 6665:
      /window server irc.foo.com:6665

   To connect to server irc.foo.com with the nickname JoeBob:
      /window server irc.foo.com:::JoeBob
