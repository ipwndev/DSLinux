Synopsis:
   window lastlog_level [<levels>]

Description:
   This works similarly to WINDOW LEVEL, except the levels specified
   determine what the client will save to its lastlog buffer for that
   window.  If no level is specified, the current setting for the window
   is displayed.

   The list of levels to use may be any of those allowed for WINDOW
   LEVEL.  A comma-delimited list may be used to specify more than one
   level at once.

Examples:
   To only remember private messages and notices for the current window:
      /window lastlog_level msg,notice

See Also:
   set(4) lastlog_level; window(4) level
