Synopsis:
   window pop

Description:
   This pops the top window off the window stack and makes it the current
   window.  If that window is hidden, it is made visible.  If it no longer
   exists, the next window on the stack is tried until an existing one is
   found.  If the stack is empty, the current window is left unchanged.
