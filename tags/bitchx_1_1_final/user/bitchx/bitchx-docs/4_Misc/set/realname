Synopsis:
   set realname [<text>]

Description:
   If set, the client will use the value of this variable as its IRCNAME
   when connecting to new servers.  The variable may be set to anything
   desired, including nothing.  If unset, the client will use the value
   in the environment variable IRCNAME, or failing that, the value in
   the user's GCOS field in the system password file.

Aliases:
   Setting this variable is essentially equivalent to using the REALNAME
   command.

See Also:
   Environment(7); realname(4); reconnect(1); server(1)

Other Notes:
   The nature of irc servers is such that this information cannot be
   changed on the fly.  The client must establish a connection with a new
   server (or reconnect to the current one) for the setting to take
   effect.
