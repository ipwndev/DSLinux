Description:
   This variable sets the string displayed in the status bar when email is

   be new.  If the user's mailbox is empty, nothing is displayed.

   This string is represented as %M in the STATUS_FORMAT string.  Within
   STATUS_MAIL, the expando will expand to the number of messages in the
   mailbox.
