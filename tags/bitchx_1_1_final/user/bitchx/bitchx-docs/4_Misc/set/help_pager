Synopsis:
   set help_pager [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned on, the client will pause after every windowful of help,
   much like HOLD_MODE.  When off, the help will scroll until the end of
   the file has been reached.

See Also:
   help(1); set(4) help_service, hold_mode; window(4) hold_mode

Other Notes:
   This setting has no effect when receiving help from a help service on
   the irc network.  Use HOLD_MODE instead.
