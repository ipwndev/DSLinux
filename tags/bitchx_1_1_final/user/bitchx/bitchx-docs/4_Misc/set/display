Synopsis:
   set display [on|off|toggle]

Description:
   When turned off, this setting will cause the client to suppress all
   messages from being displayed (though it can still act on them
   internally.  However, ECHO can still be used to explicitly print
   messages to the display.

See Also:
   echo(5); xecho(5)

Other Notes:
   This setting is automatically turned off while a script file is being
   loaded, including the .ircrc file.  It is turned on again when the
   file finishes loading.  This can be overridden by explicitly setting
   DISPLAY on inside the loaded scripts.
