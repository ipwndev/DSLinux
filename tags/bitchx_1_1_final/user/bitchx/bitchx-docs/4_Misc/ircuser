Synopsis:
   ircuser <username>

Description:
   This lets the user specify what username to send to irc servers when
   connecting to the network.  Naturally, it requires that the client
   have this set before actually connecting to the network.

   reconnect(1)

Restrictions:
   This command is generally useless for users on hosts that use identd
   (RFC 1413).  Most modern irc servers query the host's identd server
   to (try to) obtain the user's real username, and will ignore what the
   client sends it.

Other Notes:
   Yes, this is one of the more controversial elements of EPIC.  It's
   intent is to provide privacy for those who desire it.  Those who use
   it for abusive purposes can expect to be dealt with accordingly on
   the servers and networks they use.
