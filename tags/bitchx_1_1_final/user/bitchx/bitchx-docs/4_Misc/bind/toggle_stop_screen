Synopsis:
   bind <key> toggle_stop_screen

Description:
   This function is used to pause or unpause the screen.  It is effectively
   the same as setting HOLD_MODE to "toggle", except the client doesn't
   wait for a screenful of data before pausing the screen.  The screen is
   automatically unpaused if the SEND_LINE function is used.
