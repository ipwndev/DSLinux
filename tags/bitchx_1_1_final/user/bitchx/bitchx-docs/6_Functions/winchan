Synopsis:
   $chanwin(<window refnum/name>|<channel>)
   $winchan(<window refnum/name>|<channel>)

Technical:
   These functions are identical. They return one of either a window refnum
   or a channel name based on the arguments passed.

Returns:
   window refnum where <channel> resides if <channel> was passed
     or
   name of the current channel in <window refnum/name> if a window was passed

Examples:
   /window refnum 2;/join #epic
   eval echo $winchan(2)                   /* returns #epic */
   eval echo $winchan(#epic)               /* returns 2 */

Other Notes:
   These functions were once separate, but caused much confusion based on
   their name in early versions of EPIC4.
