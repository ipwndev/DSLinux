Synopsis:
   $glob(<file glob pattern>)

Technical:
   This function is used to find filenames that are matched by specified
   patterns.  This function is controlled by a compile time option, so it
   may not be available on every installation.  Multiple patterns may be
   specified.  Hidden files (dot-files) are not displayed unless a glob
    pattern beginning with a dot is given.

Practical:
   This function gives the client the file globbing abilities of modern
   Unix command shells.  It will attempt to find any file or directory
   names matching the given glob pattern.  This is highly useful for
   listing files, or finding files with similar names.

Returns:
   list of files matching input glob pattern, nothing if none match

Examples:
   $glob(~/*)    returns all non-hidden files in your home directory
   $glob(*)      returns all non-hidden files in your current directory
   $glob(.*)     returns all hidden files in your current directory
   $glob(f*)     returns all non-hidden files that start with "f" in cwd

See Also:
   fexist(6); fsize(6)

Restrictions:
   This function may not be present in all clients.  A compile-time option
   is available to disable it.  The function is present if the string
   returned by $info(o) has a "g" in it.
