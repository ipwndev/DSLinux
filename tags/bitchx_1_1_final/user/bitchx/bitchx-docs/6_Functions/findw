Synopsis:
   $findw(<word> <wordlist>)

Technical:
   This function searches <wordlist> for <word> and returns the place it was
   found. If <word> isn't in <wordlist>, -1 is returned.

Practical:
   This function should put many scripters to ease, as it has been written
   into many scripts :)

Returns:
   index to <word> in <wordlist>

Examples:
   $findw(very epic is a very scriptable client)         /* returns 3 */
   
   assign test blah hmm foo bar
   eval echo $word($findw(hmm $test) $test)              /* returns "hmm" */
