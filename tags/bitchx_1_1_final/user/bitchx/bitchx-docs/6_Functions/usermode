Synopsis:
   $usermode([<server>])

Technical:
   This function returns the client's current user mode for the specified
   server.  It will accept either a server name or list number.  If no
   server is given, the one for the current window is assumed.

Practical:
   The information returned with this function is identical to the
   contents of STATUS_UMODE in the status bar for the current server.  It's
   useful for getting the current usermodes for hidden windows without
   switching to them.  It is useful when used in conjunction with
   $winserv().

Returns:
   user mode string for current server (nothing if bad server or no modes)

Examples:
   $usermode()                      shows user mode for current server
   $usermode(2)                     shows user mode for server #2
   $usermode(irc.blah.com)          shows user mode on irc.blah.com
   $usermode(irc.fakeserver.com)    no such server, returns nothing
