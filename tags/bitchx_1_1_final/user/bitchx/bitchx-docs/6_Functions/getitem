Synopsis:
   $getitem(<array> <item#>)
   $igetitem(<array> <index#>)

Technical:
   These functions are used to fetch data held in the given array.  The
   $getitem() function retrieves data based on its item number in the array
   (counting from zero, the order in which the data was entered).  The
   $igetitem() function retrieves it based on its index number (counting
   from zero, in a sorted order).  These functions only affect arrays
   created with $setitem().

Practical:
   These functions are used to get an item in an array.  The applications
   for these function should be obvious.  The $igetitem() function, in
   particular, is useful for showing an array's contents in alphabetical
   order.

Returns:
   array item data, or empty string if array or item is not found
