Synopsis:
   $mask(<type> <address>)

Technical:
   This function returns <address> in a wildcard mask according to the type
   specified by <type>. The mask types are defined in the following table:
   
    <type>     <address> has a hostname       <address> has an ip
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
      0            *!u@h.d                        *!u@d.h
      1            *!*u@h.d                       *!*u@d.h
      2            *!*@h.d                        *!*@d.h
      3            *!*u@*.d                       *!*u@d.*
      4            *!*@*.d                        *!*@d.*
      5            n!u@h.d                        n!u@d.h
      6            n!*u@h.d                       n!*u@d.h
      7            n!*@h.d                        n!*@d.h
      8            n!*u@*.d                       n!*u@d.*
      9            n!*@*.d                        n!*@d.*
      10           *!*@h.d                        *!*@d.*
      11           *!*u@h.d                       *!*u@d.*
      12           n!*@h.d                        n!*@d.*
      13           n!*u@h.d                       n!*u@d.*

   where n=nick, u=user, h=host, and d=domain

   With the following modifications:  In the ``local'' portion of
   the hostname, all sequence of numbers are substituted with a
   single '*'.  In the username, leading ~'s are also substituted
   with a single '*'.

Returns:
   <address> in a wildcard mask according to <type>

Examples:
   $mask(3 foo!bar@long.host.blah.com)
      returns:
   *!*bar@*.blah.com

   $mask(10 nick!user@ppp-147-0-52-129.frobitz.com)
      returns:
   *!*@ppp-*-*-*-*.frobitz.com

Other Notes:
   This function strips all tildes ('~') from the left of the username. For
   script writers, this means that in mask types 0 and 5, the function is
   *NOT* guaranteed to produce a mask matching the given address. If a script
   is to use these types, they should expect tildes to be stripped and be able
   to act accordingly.
