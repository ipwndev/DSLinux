Synopsis:
   $winnam(<refnum>)

Technical:
   This returns the window name of the window specified by <refnum>, if it
   has one. If no arguments are passed, the function defaults to the current
   window.

Practical:
   This function is useful to scripts that need to know the name of the
   current window.

Returns:
   Name of the window specified by <refnum>, or name of the current window if
   no arguments are passed.
   
   Nothing is returned if the window has no name.

Examples:
   $winnum()            returns name of current window, if any
