Synopsis:
   $midw(<offset> <count> <text>)

Technical:
   This function returns the input text, starting at the given word offset,
   and not exceeding the total number of words specified.  The offset is
   counted from 0 (zero).

Practical:
   This function operates on words in the same manner that $mid() operates
   on characters, returning only a subset of the input word list.  This is
   probably mostly useful in a script, perhaps to display the partial
   contents of a variable.

Returns:
   word subset from input list, or nothing if error

Examples:
   $midw(2 2 hello there how are you?)     returns "how are"
   $midw(2 4 hello there how are you?)     returns "how are you?"
