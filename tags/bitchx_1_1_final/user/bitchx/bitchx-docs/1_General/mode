Synopsis:
   mode <your nickname|channel> [<+|-><mode> [<mode parameter(s)>]]

Description:
   Both channels and users have modes associated with them.  For channels,
   they determine who is a channel operator, the number of people who may
   join the channel, who may not enter the channel, and myriad other
   things.  For users, they determine whether the user will is an IRC
   operator, whether the user will receive special server notices, etc.

   Modes are enabled when prepended with a "+", and disabled when with a
   "-".  Modes may be clustered as well.  When clustering modes, all mode
   changes are specified first, then their parameters (see the examples
   below).

Options:
   Standard User Modes:
      i   When enabled, you are "invisible" to NAMES and WHO queries from
            anyone not on a channel common to you.  Additionally, you are
            also hidden from WHOIS unless your exact nickname is specified.
      o   When enabled, this gives you IRC operator status (however, see
            restrictions below).
      s   When enabled, you will receive special server notices (such as
            nickname collisions, fake modes, etc.).
      w   When enabled, you will receive IRC operator WALLOPS, as well as
            notices of any remote CONNECTs or SQUITs.

   Standard Channel Modes:
      b   When enabled, this prevents the specified nick!user@host mask
            from entering the channel.  If only the @host portion is
            specified, "*!*" is prepended; if only user@host is specified,
            "*!" is prepended; if the mask does not contain a "@", it is
            assumed to be a nickname, and a !*@* is appended.  When used
            with no arguments, the channels list of "bans" is displayed.
      i   When enabled, users may only join the channel if INVITEd.
      k   When enabled, users may only join the channel if they specify
            the proper "key" (which is specified when +k is set).
      l   When enabled, only the specified number of users may enter the
            channel.
      m   When enabled, only users with +o or +v may speak on the channel.
      n   When enabled, public messages from outside the channel are not
            allowed.
      o   When enabled, grants the specified nickname channel operator
            status.
      p   When enabled, the channel is made private.  The channel name
            will not show up in WHO, WHOIS, NAMES, or LIST replies (though
            users who are not +i will still be shown in NAMES, the channel
            name is simply masked as "Private").
      s   When enabled, makes the channel secret.  This is the same as +p,
            except the channel will not show up in any WHO/WHOIS/etc.
            queries from a person not on the channel.  Anyone who is on a
            +s channel is effectively invisible, as per user mode +i.
      t   When enabled, only channel operators may set a topic.
      v   When enabled, grants the specified nickname voice status.

Examples:
   To receive operator WALLOPS and server notices (both examples are
   equivalent):
      /mode your_nick +sw
      /mode your_nick +s+w

   To set a channel limit (the number is arbitrary):
      /mode #channel +l 35

   To make someone a channel operator:
      /mode #channel +o theirnick

   To set a ban, a key, and to remove chanop status from someone:
      /mode #channel +bk-o *!*some@*.ban.com Secret_Key foobar

Restrictions:
   Only channel operators may set modes for a channel (though anyone may
   view them), and only you may set or view your personal user modes.
   Additionally, the user mode +o may NOT be set with MODE, you must use
   the OPER command.  However, it may be removed with -o (see DEOP as
   well).

   Also note that some server variants do not allow for redundant mode
   changes, such as "+oo foobar foobar".  This shouldn't cause too many
   problems though, since you can easily reverse a mode if you wish to set
   it again, such as "-o+o foobar foobar", which is allowed.

   Finally, note that mode changes are limited to a maximum of 4 total
   parameters.  Thus you could give +o to 3 people and set +l, but you
   could not do those and set +k as well, since that would involve 5
   parameters.

Other Notes:
   On Undernet servers, the maximum number of parameters for MODE is 6.
   Additionally, some server versions have extra modes that may be used.
   Keep in mind that these do not apply everywhere, so you should check
   what software version your server is using to be sure (see VERSION).

   Undernet servers (ircu2.9.x):
      User Modes:
         d   When enabled, your client does not receive any public messages
               from any channel you are on. (mnemonic: deaf mode)
         k   No-kick mode.  Any client with this mode may not be kicked from
               any channel it applies to.  Limited to services.

   DALnet servers (ircu2.9.x+DAL, DAL4.x)
      User Modes:
         g   Allows operators to see all OPER attempts, and failed server
               connects.  Allows all users to see nickname collisions.
         h   Shows operators the arguments to any protocol HELP command
               issued.  Server numeric 310 is returned in WHOIS to denote
               +h users.

   IRC 2.9 servers (irc2.9.x):
      User Modes:
         r   When enabled, the client cannot be a channel operator (even if
               it is the first to join), nor can it change nicknames.  This
               mode is automatic if the connecting client has a matching i:
               line.  This mode cannot be reversed once enabled.
        (s)  Version 2.9 servers do not have a +s user mode.

      Channel Modes:
         a   When enabled, this makes the channel anonymous.  Nicknames are
               hidden (and thus nick changes are not shown), and no other
               channel modes are permitted.  Note that this can seriously
               confuse the client...

   EFnet +CS servers (irc2.8.x+CSr27 and beyond):
      User Modes:
         b   When enabled, shows connects from potential bots, and attempts
               with invalid usernames.
         c   When enabled, shows all clients connecting and disconnecting
               from your server.  Limited to irc operators.
         d   When enabled, shows connects where the username given and the
               client's ident response differ.
         f   When enabled, shows all "Fake MODE" and "Nickname Collision"
               notices.
         k   When enabled, shows all global and local operator kills.
         l   When enabled, shows connect attempts from clients that exceed
               their connect class (Y:line) limit.
        (r)  Replaced by +bdl after CSr25.
         s   When enabled, it shows any miscellaneous server notices that
               are not shown with modes bcdfklu (even if they are not
               enabled).
         u   When enabled, shows all unauthorized connect attempts, as well
               as connect attempts when the server has reached its maximum
               connection limit.

   EFnet /th servers (irc2.8/th):
      User Modes:
         c   When enabled, shows all clients connecting and disconnecting
               from your server.  Limited to IRC operators.
         d   Debug mode, displays miscellaneous messages.  Limited to irc
               operators.
         k   When enabled, shows all server kills
         n   Shows all local nickname changes.  Limited to irc operators.
         r   When enabled, shows all rejected connections.
         s   When enabled, it shows any miscellaneous server notices that
               are not shown with modes ckr, including operator kills
         y   Spy mode, informs operators of all LINKS, STATS, and TRACE
               commands issued, and of any failed MSG commands.

   AnotherNet servers
      User Modes:
         c   Show all [dis]connections, possible clones, and invalid logins
         f   Show all DCC handshakes (mnemonic: file transfers)
         h   Makes operator completely invisible to all normal users;
             mainly meant for channel services (mnemonic: hidden)
