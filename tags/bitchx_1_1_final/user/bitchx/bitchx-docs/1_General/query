Synopsis:
   query [=]<nickname>
   query %<process id|process name>

Description:
   Using the first form, QUERY starts a private conversation with the
   nicknames specified (more than one allowed, see MSG for syntax).  All
   it really does is make the client send normal typed messages to the
   people specified instead of your current channel.  QUERY will work
   over a DCC CHAT connection.

   The second form is similar to the first, but it lets you continuously
   communicate with a running EXECed process without the need for MSG
   (just like querying a person).  Either the process id number, or the
   name assigned to the process (if any) may be used.

   Using QUERY with no arguments terminates the current QUERY, if any.

Examples:
   To start a private conversation with your significant other:
      /query sweetypie

   To cancel a running query:
      /query

   msg(1); exec(5)
