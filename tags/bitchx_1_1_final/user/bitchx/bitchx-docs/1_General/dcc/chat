Synopsis:
   dcc chat <nick>

Description:
   DCC CHAT initiates a direct connection to another client, allowing
   the users to chat without needing to pass messages through the irc
   network.  This is a very secure way of communicating on irc, not
   to mention that it is generally faster than sending messages across
   the irc network.

   To send a message across the DCC CHAT connection, use MSG as you
   normally would, but prefix the nickname with a "=".  Additionally,
   CTCP commands can be sent across a DCC CHAT connection (allowing you
   to initiate a DCC SEND, for instance), if the remote client is also an
   EPIC3 (or compatible) client.  See the appropriate help files for more
   information.
