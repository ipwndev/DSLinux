Synopsis:
   dcc treget [=]<nick> [<file>]

Description:
   DCC TREGET initiates a file transfer with a remote client that has 
   offered the client a DCC TRESEND.  Naturally, a remote client must have 
   already send the client a DCC TRESEND request in order for the client to 
   start a DCC TREGET with it.  If the DCC request comes over an existing 
   DCC CHAT connection, a '=' must be prepended to the nickname.

   This command resumes the file if it exists. It is not compatible with
   mIRC.

   This method is slightly faster than a normal dcc get.

   The client need not specify the name of the file to get.  If multiple
   files are offered by the same remote client, the oldest TRESEND request
   is processed first.

Examples:
   To accept a TRESEND from joebob:
      /dcc treget joebob

   To accept all files offered to you by DCCbot:
      /dcc treget DCCbot *
