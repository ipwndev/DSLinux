Synopsis:
   ctcp [=]<nick>|<channel> ping <current time>

Description:
   This command is used to give you a general idea of how much "lag"
   (delays due to network congestion) is between you and another client.
   The current time is represented as an integer which is the number of
   seconds since 1 January 1970.  The current time in this format can
   be obtained with the $time() function.

Aliases:
   The PING command is identical to using CTCP PING with $time() as
   the "time" argument.
