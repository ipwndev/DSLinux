Synopsis:
   ctcp [=]<nick>|<channel> utc <time value>

Description:
   This is a convenient means by which to send another client the current
   time in your locale without requiring them to request it first.  The
   time value sent is in the same format as used with CTCP PING.

Examples:
   To send another client the current time in your time zone (note that
   EVAL is necessary to expand $time() to the actual value when used from
   the input line):
      /eval ctcp nickname utc $time()

Other Notes:
   CTCP UTC is used primarily by robots or other automatons.  Unlike
   other CTCP commands, an automatic reply is not generated.  Instead,
   it appears to the recipient as a normal MSG.
