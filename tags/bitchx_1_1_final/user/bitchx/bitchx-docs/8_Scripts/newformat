Description:
   This script is primarily meant as an extension to 2.8script, though it
   can be used alone without problems.  It mostly adds commands useful to
   irc operators, as well as cleaning up STATS and TRACE output.

     Command
     /cleantr   purge the list of servers from the last TRACE
     /conall    connect to all servers from last TRACE (usually after
                | restarting one's server)
     /invite    same as INVITE, but current channel is used if none given
     /topic     same as TOPIC, but current channel is used if none given
     /tt        toggles display of normal users in STATS and TRACE output
                | (also bound to ESC-t)
