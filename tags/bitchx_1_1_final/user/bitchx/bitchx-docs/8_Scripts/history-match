Synopsis:
   load history-match

Description:
   This script attempts to emulate the T-Shell's (tcsh) history completion
   capabilities, ESC-p.  The script binds META2-p to this function (META2
   is bound to ^X by default).  It allows for both command completion and
   argument completion from the client's command history.  If multiple
   matches are found in the history, repeated ^X-p will cycle through each
   possibility.

Other Notes:
   This script is believed to have been written by Matthew Green (phone).
