Synopsis:
   load follow

Description:
   This script was originally written as an exercise in creativity.  It
   provides two functions intended to aid users in following other users,
   even after their nicknames change, by using output from WHOWAS as input
   to WHO.

   The first function is $follow(), which takes a single nickname argument.
   It attempts to find any users currently on irc with the same address as
   that belonging to the given nickname.

   The second is $ffollow(), which takes a nickname, and an optional
   channel name, as arguments.  It is similar to $follow(), but only works
   for users that are on the same channels as the client.  This function
   requires that the GUH script also be loaded.

   This script was written by Jeremy Nelson (hop), jnelson@acronet.net.
