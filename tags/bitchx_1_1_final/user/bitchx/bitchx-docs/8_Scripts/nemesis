Synopsis:
   load nemesis

Description:
   This script is an interface to the |Nemesis IRC-MUD gateway bot.  It
   opens a new client window to display the MUD activity in.  A pair of
   aliases are provided, /nwho and /ntell.  The first issues the "who"
   command to the |Nemesis bot, and the second issues a "tell" command.
   Any additional arguments are also passed along to the bot.

Other Notes:
   This script was written in 1992, so it's probably safe to say that the
   |Nemesis bot no longer exists.  The script itself was written by Carl
   von Loesch (lynx).
