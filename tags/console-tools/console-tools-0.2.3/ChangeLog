	* Started french l10n.
	* Fixed a typo in ga.po.
	* Finally got something out of gettext, after several hours of

	files).
	
Fri Feb 19 00:29:10 1999  Yann Dirson

	* Adapted some Makefile.am's for libtool 1.2d + automake 1.4

	* Fixed compressed-magic test in do_pipe() - had unpredictable
	results when only 1st half of gzip/compress magic matched (thanks
	"gcc -Wall").
	* Fixed option handling in loadkeys and dumpkeys, which caused bad

	maxfullength.
	** Added findfile_simple() wrapper around findfile, with kbd syntax

	** Pass DATADIR, KEYMAPSDIR as -D switches to cpp in kbtools/.
	The keymap parser should move into lib/ instead.

	(and fixed manpage error which told "-v" was "--version").
	** Documented new option --shape for dumpkeys in usage() and
	manpage.
	** Changed findfile() to use a recursive algorithm (took some code
	from kbd 0.96).
	
Mon May 18 15:50:00 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Sync'ed with kbd 0.96:
	** utils:
	*** xmalloc() and xstrdup() wrappers in miscutils.c/utils.h

	** ksyms:
	*** Added symbolic names for latin5 (iso-8859-9) charset.
	*** KeyboardSignal is now the primary name, and Spawn_Console the
	alias name.
	*** When assuming a char belongs to another charset, include the
	char's name in the message printed.

	** loadkeys:
	*** support for symbolic names in composition result.
	*** support for "strings as usual" and "compose as usual"
	keywords.
	*** support include files (depends on flex). Env LOADKEYS_INCLUDE_PATH
	can be used.
	*** use <lct/modifiers.h> to define M_* symbols.
	*** correctly support keymaps files without a "keymaps" line.
	*** use lkfatal*() for errors.
	*** added --quiet (-q) option.
	*** added support for multiple verbosity levels (-v -v)
	*** internally check for errors (more robust ?)

	** dumpkeys:
	*** added --separate-lines (-1) and --shape (-S) options - layout
	code was reworked.

	** NOT MERGED:
	*** "showkey -a": already provided (better IMHO) by "-k".
	*** showfont patch is unrelevant for the LCT.
	
Mon May  4 14:22:12 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Rewritten `make-fallbacks' and `make-nofallbacks' from scratch

	.fallback and .nofallback files.
	* Added `force-fallbacks' make target that force rebuilding of
	auto-generated .fallback and .nofallback files.
	* Added comment line showing involved chars' descriptions in
	generated .fallback files.
	
Wed Apr 29 16:58:13 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Renamed `showfont' to `showcfont' to avoid namespace clash with
	X11 fontserver utility from xcontrib.

	zone - that's a lot simpler.  Thanks to H. Peter Anvin who
	reminded me to do so.
	* Renamed `make-latin-fallback' script to `make-fallbacks';
	generalized it to be regexp-driven.

	"erroneous display"
	* Removed acm_deactivate() function.

Mon Apr  6 19:05:57 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Normalized source layout in loadkeys.y.
	* Block SIGCHLD while running yyparse() in loadkeys.y, to prevent
	the scanner from aborting.
	* Block SIGCHLD in sfm-fallback-read() - suppressed test for
	EINTR.

	for EINTR in do_pipe().

Thu Apr  2 16:24:01 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Made uni_screen_map_read_ascii() EINTR-safe. Should make ACM
 	files compress-safe.
	* Improved error-condition checks reading ACM's.
	* Fixed configure to not display the "programs may not build"
	message when no such programs.
	* Added retry/timeout mechanism waiting for undead children in
	findfile(), so that they have time to die - NOTE: findfile() is
	probably NOT thread-safe.
	* Turned around a problem that gets some SIGCHLD's lost, in
	addition to the above-mentionned retry/timeout: maybekillzombie().
	* Made build of resizecons and keycode-progs enabled by default,
	in order to get quicker feedback.
	* Added support for lzop compression program.

Tue Mar 31 17:37:41 1998  Yann Dirson

Mon Jan  5 20:12:30 1998  Yann Dirson

	* Modified compressed-file support to allow support for multiple
 	decompressors, while using a "main_compressor" to install data

Changes for console-tools_1997.11.13 (ydi):

o Created doc/lct.txt.

o Added SFM to PSF files that missed them, when available.
o Converted all distributed raw fonts to PSF, with SFM when I was sure
  enough I should be right.

  Graphic_0 to Graphic_63) into ksyms.c.
o Conditionnaly (-DGGI_PATCH) added (old ?) GGI patch to loadkeys.y.

  in data/consoletrans/.
o Moved find*() wrappers back into libctutils; added one for sfmfallback's.
o Added unimapdesc_adjust() for memory-optimizing purposes.
o Changed proto for _addpair() [was mis-designed - caused one realloc() per
  call !]
o Added "--no-act" and "default-font" switches to `consolechars'.
o Changed default font syntax to "default8x%02d" (was "..8x%d"); thus renamed
  "default8x8" to "default8x08".

o Fixed loadunimap, saveunimap, mapscrn compat scripts.
o Corrected Changelog for 1997.10.28 to not read 1997.10.23 ;)
o Fixed allocated size in unimapdesc_addpair() [hopefully we never had more
  than 1024 entries in a SFM, so it never showed].
o Changed gzip invocation to be robust about warnings, and let him warn the
  user (suppressed "-q").
o Fixed use of getopt in consolechars.c and vt-is-UTF8.c.
o Fixed problem with --enable-local-datadir in fiondfile-lct.c.


Changes for console-tools_1997.10.28 (ydi):

  composition.
o Changed `unicode_start' to not load any font when called with no arguments

  512-chars fonts; now displays in RtoL_then_TtoB mode.
o Renamed "getfd()" to "get_console_fd()".
o Repartitionned libconsole and libconsoletools. Each has its own header now.
  Many "#include" statements changed for this ;)

  homogeneized sfm_{rd,wr}*() arguments ordering.
o Suppressed need for sfm-size-hint in sfm_rd_binary().
o Had many library functions set errno and return -1 on fail instead of exiting.
o Changed findfile.c::do_pipe() to return NULL on error (was (FILE*)(-1)).
o Renamed findunimap() to findsfm(), findmap() to findacm().
o Allowed xfseek(,,SEEK_SET) to go forward in unseekable files.
o Created manpages for: unicode_stop, unicode_start, showfont.
o Made findfile() handle SIGCHLD, while trying to be kind to user's SIGCHLD
  handler.
o Added magic-number checking to findfile().

o Moved doc/misc/utf{demo,list} to examples/

o Updated from Ricardas Cepas <rch@pub.osf.lt> (linux-lt-0.97):
 	lt{,.l4}.kmap
	lat4{,u}-{08,10,12,14,16,16+,19}.psf
 	lat4{,u}.sfm
	koi8-r.sfm
o Updated cf.kmap from Nicolas Pitre <nico@CAM.ORG>.
o Contributed by Ricardas Cepas:
	LatArCyrHeb-{08,14,16,16+,19}.psf
	
o Fixed `showfont' display problem with CSI char (code 155), by using
  upper 64 font-posistions instead of upper 128 ones.
o "gcc -W -Wall" cleanup in most sources.
o Do not install `clrunimap', as it will now break the display more often.
o Fixed acm_{,de}activate() by making get_console_fd() open the console R/W
  instead of R/O.
o Fixed CP-loading code.
o Fixed (?) xfseek() to expect ESPIPE from fseek(), in addition of EBADF.
o Fixed display bug in showkey when run with no explicit command.
o Fixed `showfont' to restore original UTF/byte mode on exit.


Changes for console-tools_1997.10.14 (ydi):

o Better configure-support for compressor-use: added "--with-compressor"
  option (ct_PROG_COMPRESSOR).
o Somewhat cleaned up ksyms.c::set_charset()

  though still don't know what "unicode" is for here.
o Cleaned up use of "verbose" - turned libocal.a into libconsoletools.la.
o Renamed "resizevt" to "resizecons" again, as screen size is currently an
  attribute of the console, not of the VT.
o Dropped mapscreen loadunimap getunimap as obsoleted by setfont.
o Added warning-printing to setfont.c::main() and loadnewfont() for
  operations leading the kernel to an invalid-unimap state (see file `NEWS'
  for details)

o Fixed unimap-misc.c::kernel_get_unimap() to handle the case where the
  unimap is considered invalid by the kernel.
o Made "setfont" to load the default unimap when loading a default font.
o Allowed "setfont -op" to output 512-chars fonts.
o setfont.c::saveoldfont() is now robust, and doesn't produce invalid files
  when all data isn't available.
o Fixed deallocvt to deallocate all possible VTs, instead of exiting as soon
  as one deallocation failed.
o Fixed dumpkeys.c::usage() to display really-available charsets for
  "--charset" option.
o Fixed findfile() to allow "-" as filename when compression support not
  compiled in.
  
o Splitted TODO into TODO and BUGS.
o Updated most manpages.


Changes from kbd_0.94 to console-tools_1997.10.03 (ydi):

o Reorganized source tree (splitted src into 4 dirs, moved "man?" into doc,
  	original doc into doc/misc, doc/TODO into top level dir.
o Moved much stuff into lib, factorized bunches of code.
o Converted build to autoconf/automake/libtool.
o "analyse.l" is now compiled (was included into loadkeys.y)
o Do not compile spawn_*.c - they are examples.
o Compressed consoletrans/* and consolefonts/*.psf.
o Renamed "resizecons" to "resizevt".
o Moved "sti, "vcstime" out of contrib/; renamed "sti" to "writevt".
o Changed extension for "unimap" files from ".uni" to ".sfm", for "Screen
	Font Map"; changed extension for keymaps from ".map" to ".kmap";
 	added extension for "console/screen maps" as ".acm", for
 	"App. Charset Map"; added support for these extensions in
 	`findfile.c'; kept original 8-bit kept "console maps" without an
 	extension; ".uni" for compatibility with "kbd".
o Make mk_modmap install in $(BINDIR).
o Suppressed inclusion of <linux/termios.h> in both setvesablank.c and
  	screendump.c, to allow compilation under debian's
 	libc6_2.0.4-1. Doesn't seem to hurt even with libc5, anyway.
o Added warning to contrib/codepage that CP format is a hack.
o Miscellaneous minor improvements.

o Fixed file-compression code; fixed psf-loading code to allow
  	compression; added `compress' support.
o Added /usr/local/share lookups for every /usr/share lookup, but disabled
 	its use by default. Use "configure --enable-localdatadir" to use
 	it as in 0.94.2.
o Included endianness patch from Debian.
o Factorized getunimap into libconsole; added it to the list of obsolete
  	programs.
o Made setfont exit after printing version when given '-V'.
o Make use in every program of miscutils::strip_path(argv[0]) to display its
  	name.
o Forbid on command-line '-X none -X file' for X in [mu], just as it was for
  	'-X file1 -X file2' or '-X file -X none'.
o Added -op and -opu options to setfont.
o Obsoleted in setfont option -o with -or to encourage using -op[u].
o setfont now fully supports writting to stdout/reading from stdin.
o Added support to load for 16-bit ASCII screen maps.
o Suppressed "-m space" from `unicode_start' to prevent it from breaking
  	screen maps.
o Fixed bug in lib/miscutils::open_a_console(), for when it'll be exported by
  	the lib (fd wasn't closed).
o Added message in screendump telling when trying ioctl; previously existing
  	messages alone were too confusing IMHO.
o Made screendump without arguments look at /dev/vcs[a] instead of 
  	/dev/vcs[a]0, which are not created by MAKEDEV.
o Reworked option-handling in showkey (distinguished between commands and
  	options).
o Added --keymap and --timeout options to showkey.
o Told showkey that K_UNICODE exists (was "??UNKNOWN??").
o Fixed vcstime so that it handles screens more than 127-chars wide.
	
o Created NEWS file for user-level changes/fixes.
o Changed filename "CHANGES" to "ChangeLog", and reversed versions order.
o Added notices about init(8) and about the `open' package in spawn_*.c.
o Created `examples' directory. Stuffed with {sample.rc,spawn_*.c}
o Updated manpages: showkey.1 setfont.8.in.
o Sync-ed with implementation many files from doc/misc.  Renamed
  	`keysyms.h.info' to `keysyms.h.txt', it was no info file.
o Moved the file with UTF8-encoded name from doc/misc/ into examples/
o Created doc/file-formats for PSF/raw/cp/cpi/XPSF descriptions.
o Replaced consolefonts/psffile.doc with doc/file-formats/psf.
o Created doc/file-formats/{raw,cpi,cp,xpsf.draft}, and .../TMPL as a
  	template for new descriptions.
o Replaced psf.magic with doc/fonts/fonts.magic.
o Added CPI and XPSF to fonts.magic, and a hack-magic for CP.

Changes for 0.91 (aeb):

o Added hpa's setfont patch.

Changes for 0.90 (aeb):

o Changed setfont to subsume mapscrn and escape sequence.
o Added hpa's psftable stuff.
o Added Unicode stuff (requires kernel 1.1.92 or later).

Changes for 0.89 (aeb):

o Some minor things.

Changes for 0.88 (aeb):

o Added dynamic keymap support. Added "keymaps" directive.
o Added dynamic console allocation. Added disalloc.
o Added resize.
o Changed LED handling.
o Added the contributed codepage.c (to extract codepages from a
  DOS .cpi file).
o Many minor changes.

Changes for 0.87 (aeb):

o Added iso-8859-8 support. Added "charset" directive.
o Corrected a typo in "trivial".
o Added kbd_mode.
o Extended kbd.FAQ. Added contributed keymaps and fonts.

Changes for 0.85-0.86 (aeb):

o Minor things only. Added contributed keymaps and fonts.

Changes for 0.84 (aeb):

o Added more compose key support to loadkeys.
o Setfont, loadkeys and mapscrn look by default in /usr/lib/kbd/*.
o Setfont can read codepage font files (and select a font from them).
o Many minor changes.

Changes for 0.83 (aeb):

o Added KT_LETTER, so that CapsLock can work correctly.
  For the time being, this is denoted by a leading + in the keymap.
o Added setfont, showfont, mapscrn.
o Added setleds, setmetamode.
o Put data by default in three subdirectories of /usr/lib/kbd.

Changes from version 0.81 to version 0.82 (aeb@cwi.nl):

o Made mktable an option of loadkeys, so that the file defkeymap.c
  produced is independent of the current kernel, and independent of
  the current keyboard settings. (The old mktable program is now
  obsolete.)
o After  dumpkeys > x; loadkeys x; dumpkeys > y  the files x and y
  should be identical. They were not. I hope they are now.
o Showkey now restores the original keyboard mode.
o Loadkeys now accepts quotes and backslashes in strings.
o Added compose key support.

Changes from version 0.8 to version 0.81:

o Updated and fixed the keytable files
o Minor additions to the loadkeys man page
o Added support for ISO 8859-{2,3,4} character symbols, updated
  dumpkeys man page accordingly

Changes from the prerelease to version 0.8:

o Enhanced the shorthand notation `keycode xx = a', where `a' is an
  ASCII letter and changed `dumpkeys' and `loadkeys' accordingly.
  Now this entry defines useful values in shift+control, meta+shift,
  meta+control and meta+control+shift keytables, too. AltGr entries
  also default now to the value of non-AltGr entries.
o Added the possibility to split long lines into multiple shorter ones
  by appending a backslash at the end of each partial line.
o Added a version number and a short usage message to `dumpkeys'
o Added the options --short-info, --long-info (replaces the symbol
  dump, -s), --numeric, --full-table, --funcs-only, --keys-only to
  `dumpkeys'. See manpage for more info.
o Added a version number, a short usage message and the ability to load
  multiple map files at a time to `loadkeys'.
o Added the utility `mktable' to generate the kernel default binding
  table automatically from the currently loaded keytable.
o Added the utility `showkey' for interactively inspecting the
  scancodes and keycode values sent by key presses and releases.
o Fixed the value of Uncaps_Shift, eliminated obsolete Map_xx symbols
o Added Meta_Control_xxx symbols.
o Added symbols for locking modifiers (kernel 0.99pl12 doesn't support this)
