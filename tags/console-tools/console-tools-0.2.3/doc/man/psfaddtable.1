.TH PSFADDTABLE 1 "28 Oct 1997" "Console tools" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME
psfaddtable \- add a Unicode character table to a console font

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psfaddtable
.I fontfile tablefile [outfile]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "psfaddtable command" "" "\fLpsfaddtable\fR command"  

.B psfaddtable
takes a console font in .psf format given by
.I fontfile
and merges it with the Unicode character table given by
.I tablefile
to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is written to
.I outfile
if given, or else to standard output.  Either
.I fontfile
or
.I outfile
(but not both) can be replaced by a single dash (\-) to read from standard
input instead.  If the
.I fontfile
already contains an embedded character table, it is ignored.

.SH TABLE FILE FORMAT
Each line in the
.I tablefile
should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by
.IR # ),
or contain a sequence of numbers in either decimal (default), octal (preceded
by
.IR 0 ),
or hexadecimal (preceded by
.IR 0x )
format.  The first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font
that is being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a 256\-character
font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512\-character font.  Any subsequent numbers on the
same line are Unicodes matched by this specific glyph slot.  It is
permissible to have multiple lines for the same glyph.
