Win32 port of audiofile, August 2001,  Chris Wolf <cwolf@starclass.com>
===========================================================================
This is the win32 port of the audiofile library and utilities.
It has only been tested using MSVC v6 on Windows 2000 server, but
should build on other win32 platforms as long as MCVC v6 is used.

BUILDING

  Before running either the command-line build, or IDE build, run the
  script "prebuild.bat".  This will create the required working directories.

  Command line build:
  The libraries and executables may be built by invoking "build_all.bat".

  Note that the makefiles are generated from the IDE, and are thus a 
  reflection of the workspace and project file states.  It is strongly
  recommended to make changes via the IDE and export the makefiles,
  rather than tweaking the makefiles directly.

  IDE build:
  Load the "all.dsw" workspace.  This workspace loads and manages the
  the dependent project files.  To perform a build, from the "build"
  menu, select the "build" menu item.


DIRECTORIES

  Debug and release versions of both the static and dynamic (DLL) libraries
  will be created in the win32/lib directory.

  The debug and release versions of the statically and dynamically linked
  versions of the executables will be created in the following directories:

  Debug/bin/static
  Debug/bin/dynamic
  Relase/bin/static
  Relase/bin/dynamic

  N.B. In order to execute the dynamically linked executables, the 
       corresponding DLL's must be in the PATH.  There are two options:

       1.) put the fully qualified path of "win32/lib" in the PATH.

       2.) copy "audiofile.dll" and/or "audiofileD.dll" to a directory
           which is already in the PATH. 


LIBRARY NAMING CONVENTIONS

  There is an ambiguity with Microsoft's naming convention; a file with
  a "*.lib" extension could either be a static library, or a DLL export
  library, therefore the following naming convention is adopted to resolve
  the ambiguity:

  Static Library:      libBASENAME.lib   e.g. libaudiofile.lib
  DLL export Library:  BASENAME.lib      e.g. audiofile.lib

  In addition, appending "D" to the basename denotes a debug version of
  the library. e.g. libaudiofileD.lib, audiofileD.dll

  The module definition file (audiofile.def) does not explicitly name
  the library, in order for the linker to set the name based on the 
  type of build.
