This directory is for running on a simulated NEC V850E processor using
the GDB v850e simulator.  You must have already built a gdb that
contains the simulator, and any apropriate patches needed by linux
(more information can be found in the `arch/v850/sim' directory in the
kernel directory).

Then you will be able to use a command like

   v850e-elf-gdb image.elf

in the `images' directory to run linux on the simulated processor.
