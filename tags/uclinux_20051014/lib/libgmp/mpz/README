This directory contains functions for GMP's integer function layer.

In this version of GMP, integers are represented like in the figure below.
(Please note that the format might change between every version, and that
depending on the internal format in any way is a bad idea.)

	<------- _mp_size ------->


The most significant limb will be non-zero.  The _mp_size field's sign
reflects the sign of the number.  Its absolute value is the count of limbs
in the number.
