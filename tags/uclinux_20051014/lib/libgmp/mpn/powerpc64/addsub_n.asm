# This is just crafted for testing some ideas, and verifying that we can make
# it run fast.  It runs at 2.55 cycles/limb on the 630, which is very good.
# We should play a little with the schedule.  No time has been spent on that.

# To finish this, the loop warm up and cool down code needs to be written,
# and the result need to be tested.  Also, the proper calling sequence should
# be used.

#             r1p r2p s1p s2p n
# Use reg r0, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12
