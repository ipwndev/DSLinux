;;; Commentary:
;;
;; gmpasm-mode is an editing mode for m4 processed assembler code and m4
;; macro files in GMP.  It's similar to m4-mode, but has a number of
;; settings better suited to GMP.
;;
;;
;; Install
;; -------
;;
;; To make M-x gmpasm-mode available, put gmpasm-mode.el somewhere in the
;; load-path and the following in .emacs
;;
;;	(autoload 'gmpasm-mode "gmpasm-mode" nil t)
;;
;; To use gmpasm-mode automatically on all .asm and .m4 files, put the
;; following in .emacs
;;
;;	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.asm\\'" . gmpasm-mode))
;;	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m4\\'" . gmpasm-mode))
;;
;; To have gmpasm-mode only on gmp files, try instead something like the
;; following, which uses it only in a directory starting with "gmp", or a
;; sub-directory of such.
;;
;;	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
;;	             '("/gmp.*/.*\\.\\(asm\\|m4\\)\\'" . gmpasm-mode))
;;
;; Byte compiling will slightly speed up loading.  If you want a docstring
;; in the autoload you can use M-x update-file-autoloads if you set it up
;; right.
;;
;;
;; Emacsen
;; -------
;;
;; FSF Emacs 20.x - gmpasm-mode is designed for this.
;; XEmacs 20.x - seems to work.
;;
;; FSF Emacs 19.x - should work if replacements for some 20.x-isms are
;;    available.  comment-region with "C" won't really do the right thing
;;    though.

(defun gmpasm-mode ()
  "A major mode for editing GNU MP asm and m4 files.

`comment-start' and `comment-end' are set buffer-local to assembler
commenting appropriate for the CPU by looking for something matching
`gmpasm-comment-start-regexp' at the start of a line, or \"#\" is used if
there's no match (if \"#\" isn't what you want, type in a desired comment
and do \\[gmpasm-mode] to reinitialize).

`adaptive-fill-regexp' is set buffer-local to the standard regexp with
`comment-start' and dnl added.  If filladapt.el has been loaded it similarly
gets `comment-start' and dnl added as buffer-local fill prefixes.

Font locking has the m4 builtins, some of the GMP macros, m4 dnl commenting,
and assembler commenting (based on the `comment-start' determined).

Note that `gmpasm-comment-start-regexp' is only matched as a whole word, so
the `C' in it is only matched as a whole word, not on something that happens
to start with `C'.  Also it's only the particular `comment-start' determined
that's added for filling etc, not the whole `gmpasm-comment-start-regexp'.

`gmpasm-mode-hook' is run after initializations are complete.
