For a number of reasons it is not practical for Linux-PAM to be
distributed with every module out there.  However, this shell script
is intended as a convenient way for users to download modules from the
'net in some semiautomated fashion.

Please feel free to send (pam-list@redhat.com) snippets of code that
will help others to download and unpack your favorite module into the
Linux-PAM source tree.  Especially welcome are snippets of the
following form:

ncftp ftp://my.ftpsite.org/pub/fluff/pam_fluff.tar.gz
rm -fr pam_fluff
tar zvfx pam_fluff.tar.gz

Cheers
