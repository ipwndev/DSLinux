pam_radius module:
	RADIUS session module.

WHAT IT DOES:
	This module is intended to provide the session service for users
autheticated with a RADIUS server. At the present stage, the only option
supported is the use of the RADIUS server as an accounting server. There are
few things which needs to be cleared out first in the PAM project until one
will be able to use this module and expect it to magically start pppd in
response to a RADIUS server command to use PPP for this user, or to initiate
a telnet connection to another host, or to hang and call back the user using
parameters provided in the RADIUS server response. Most of these things are
better suited for the radius login application. I hope to make available
Real Soon (tm) patches for the login apps to make it work this way.


ARGUMENTS RECOGNIZED:
    debug		verbose logging

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED:
	session            _open_session and _close_session
	
	When opening a session, this module sends an Accounting-Start
message to the RADIUS server, which will log/update/whatever a database for
this user. On close, an Accounting-Stop message is sent to the RADIUS
server.

This module have no other pre-requisites for making it work. One can install
a RADIUS server just for fun and use it as a centralized accounting server and
forget about wtmp/last/sac&comp :-)

USAGE:
	For the services you need this module (login for example) put
	the following line in /etc/pam.conf as the last line for that
	service (usually after the pam_unix session line):

	login   session    required     /lib/security/pam_radius.so

	Replace "login" for each service you are using this module.

	This module make extensive use of the API provided in libpwdb
	0.54preB or later. By default, it will read the radius server
	configuration (hostname and secret) from /etc/raddb/server. This is
	a default compiled into libpwdb, and curently there is no way to
	modify this default without recompiling libpwdb. I am working on
	extending the radius support from libpwdb to provide a possibility
	to make this runtime-configurable.

	Also please note that libpwdb will require also the RADIUS
	dictionary to be present (/etc/raddb/dictionary).

TODO:
	The work is far from complete. Deal with "real" session things.
