.TP 
\fB\-l FILE, \-\-log=FILE\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-leave\-temps\fR
Do not remove temporary files.
.TP 
\fB\-r, \-\-recursive\fR
Scan directories recursively. All the subdirectories in the given directory will be scanned.
.TP 
\fB\-\-bell\fR
Sound bell on virus detection.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-summary\fR
Do not display summary at the end of scanning.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exclude=PATT, \-\-exclude\-dir=PATT\fR
Don't scan file/directory names containing PATT. It may be used multiple times.
.TP 
\fB\-\-include=PATT, \-\-include\-dir=PATT\fR
Only scan file/directory names containing PATT. It may be used multiple times.
.TP 
\fB\-i, \-\-infected\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-mail\fR
Disable scanning of mail files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-pe\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By default ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and attempts to decompress popular executable packers such as UPX, Petite, and FSG. This option \fBdisables\fR PE support and should be used with care!
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-ole2\fR
Disable support for Microsoft Office document files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-html\fR
Disable support for HTML detection and normalisation.

.TP 
\fB\-\-detect\-broken\fR
Mark broken executables as viruses (Broken.Executable).
.TP 
\fB\-\-block\-encrypted\fR
Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
.TP 
\fB\-\-block\-max\fR
Mark archives as viruses (e.g. RAR.ExceededFileSize, Zip.ExceededFilesLimit) if max\-files, max\-space, or max\-recursion is reached.
.TP 
\fB\-\-mail\-follow\-urls\fR
If an email contains URLs ClamAV can download and scan them. \fBWARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack. Never use it on loaded servers.\fR
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-files=#n\fR
Extract first #n files from each archive. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 500)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-space=#n\fR
Extract first #n kilobytes from each archive. You may give the number in megabytes in format xM or xm, where x is a number. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 10 MB)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-recursion=#n\fR
Set archive recursion level limit. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 8).
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-ratio=#n\fR
Set maximum archive compression ratio limit. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 250).
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-dir\-recurion=#n\fR
Maximum depth directories are scanned at (default: 15).
.TP 
\fB\-\-unzip[=FULLPATH]\fR
In most cases you don't need this option \- the built\-in unarchiver will do extract Zip archives. This option however may be used as a backup for internal unpacker \- see the full documentation for more information. When enabled without an argument, unzip program will be searched in $PATH. If unzip cannot be found in $PATH, you must force it with =pathname. Remember about '=' between the option and an argument.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unrar[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .rar files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unarj[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .arj files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unzoo[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .zoo files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-lha[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .lzh files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-jar[=FULLPATH]\fR
clamscan uses unzip for .jar files, so optionally eventually you will need to pass a full path to unzip.
.TP 
\fB\-\-deb[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports debian binary packages. Implies \-\-tgz, but doesn't conflict with \-\-tgz=FULLPATH. It requires ar utility.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tar[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports non\-compressed archives.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tgz[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports tar.gz and .tgz files. You need GNU tar, on non\-Linux system you probably have it installed as gtar. If it's in $PATH, please use \-\-tgz=gtar in other case please pass a full path.
