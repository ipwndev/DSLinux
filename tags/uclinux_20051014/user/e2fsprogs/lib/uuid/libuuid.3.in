.SH NAME
libuuid \- DCE compatible Universally Unique Identifier library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <uuid/uuid.h>
.sp
.B cc
.I file.c
.B \-luuid
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B libuuid
library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects that may be
accessible beyond the local system.  The Linux implementation was created
to uniquely identify ext2 filesystems created by a machine.  This library
generates UUIDs compatible with those created by the Open Software
Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) utility 
.BR uuidgen .
.sp
The UUIDs generated by this library can be reasonably expected to be
unique within a system, and unique across all systems.  They could
be used, for instance, to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple
web servers without communication between the servers, and without fear
of a name clash.
