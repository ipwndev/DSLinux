.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iwevent
display Wireless Events received through the RTNetlink socket. Each
line display the specific Wireless Event which describe what has
happened on the specified wireless interface.

This command doesn't take any arguments.

.SH DISPLAY
There is two classes of Wireless Events.
.PP
The first class is events related to a change of wireless settings on
the interface (typically done through
.B iwconfig
or a script calling
.BR iwconfig ).
Only settings that could result in a disruption of connectivity are
reported. The events currently reported are changing one of the
following setting :
.br
.I "	Network ID"
.br
.I "	ESSID"
.br
.I "	Frequency"
.br
.I "	Mode"
.br
.I "	Encryption"
.br
All those events will be generated on all wireless interfaces by the
kernel wireless subsystem (but only if the driver has been converted
to the new driver API).
.PP
The second class of events are events generated by the hardware, when
something happens or a task has been finished. Those events include :
.TP
.B New Access Point/Cell address
The interface has joined a new Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost
its association with it. This is the same MAC address that is reported
by
.BR iwconfig .
.TP
.B Scan request completed
A scanning request has been completed, results of the scan are
available (see
.BR iwlist ).
.TP
.B Tx packet dropped
A packet directed at this address has been dropped because the
interface believes this node doesn't answer anymore (usually maximum
of MAC level retry exceeded). An early indication that the node may
have left the cell or gone out of range, but may be due to fading or
excessive contention.
.TP
.B Custom driver event
Event specific to the driver. Please check the driver documentation.
.TP
.B Registered node
The interface has successfully registered a new wireless
client/peer. Will be generated mostly when the interface act as an
Access Point (mode master).
.TP
.B Expired node
The registration of the client/peer on this interface has
expired. Will be generated mostly when the interface act as an Access
Point (mode master).
.TP
.B Spy threshold crossed
The signal strength for one of the address in the spy list went under
the low threshold or went above than the high threshold.
.PP
Only some of those events will be generated on some wireless
interfaces by the wireless driver, and their support depend on the
specific hardware/driver combination. Please refer to driver
documentation for details.
