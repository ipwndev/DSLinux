The remote host seems to be a Checkpoint FW-1 running SecureRemote.
Letting attackers know that you are running FW-1 may enable them to
focus their attack or will make them change their attack strategy.
You should not let this information leak out.
Furthermore, an attacker can perform a denial of service attack on the
machine.

Solution:
Restrict access to this port from untrusted networks.

Risk factor : Low
