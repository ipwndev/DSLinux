# Looking for the hints? You're in the right place. 
# The hints are near each test, so search for "TEST #", where
# the pound sign is replaced by the number of the test.

# I'd like to include some more robust tests, but anything
# too subtle to be detected here would require a time-consuming
# test. Also, of course, we're here to detect only flaws in Perl;
# if there are flaws in the underlying system rand, that's not
# our responsibility. But if you want better tests, see
# The Art of Computer Programming, Donald E. Knuth, volume 2,
# chapter 3. ISBN 0-201-03822-6 (v. 2)

    # mis-configurations. Your system's documentation
    # for rand(2) should tell you what value you need
    # for randbits. Usually the diagnostic message
    # has the right value as well. Just fix it and
    # recompile, and you'll usually be fine. (The main 
    # reason that the diagnostic message might get the
    # wrong value is that Config.pm is incorrect.)

	print "# have taken over your computer. For starters, see about\n";
	print "# trying a better value for randbits, probably smaller.\n";

	# to put d_martians into Config.pm

	print "ok 1\n";
    }

    # Hints for TEST 2
    #

    # If this test is failing, something is seriously wrong,
    # either in perl or your system's rand function.

    # Hints for TEST 3
    #
    # This is just a crude test. The average number produced
    # by rand should be about one-half. But once in a while
    # it will be relatively far away. Note: This test will
    # occasionally fail on a perfectly good system!
    # See the hints for test 4 to see why.
    #
    $sum /= $reps;
    if ($sum < 0.4 or $sum > 0.6) {
	print "not ok 3\n# Average random number is far from 0.5\n";
    } else {
	print "ok 3\n";
    }

    # Hints for TEST 4
    #
    #   NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
    # This test will fail .1% of the time on a normal system.
    #				also
    # This test asks you to see these hints 100% of the time!
    #   NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
    #
    # There is probably no reason to be alarmed that
    # something is wrong with your rand function. But,
    # if you're curious or if you can't help being 
    # alarmed, keep reading.
    #
    # This is a less-crude test than test 3. But it has
    # the same basic flaw: Unusually distributed random
    # values should occasionally appear in every good
    # random number sequence. (If you flip a fair coin
    # twenty times every day, you'll see it land all
    # heads about one time in a million days, on the
    # average. That might alarm you if you saw it happen
    # on the first day!)
    #
    # So, if this test failed on you once, run it a dozen
    # times. If it keeps failing, it's likely that your
    # rand is bogus. If it keeps passing, it's likely
    # that the one failure was bogus. If it's a mix,
    # read on to see about how to interpret the tests.
    #
    # The number printed in square brackets is the
    # standard deviation, a statistical measure
    # of how unusual rand's behavior seemed. It should
    # fall in these ranges with these *approximate*
    # probabilities:
    #
    #		under 1		68.26% of the time
    #		1-2		27.18% of the time
    #		2-3		 4.30% of the time
    #		over 3		 0.26% of the time
    #
    # If the numbers you see are not scattered approximately
    # (not exactly!) like that table, check with your vendor
    # to find out what's wrong with your rand. Or with this
    # algorithm. :-)
