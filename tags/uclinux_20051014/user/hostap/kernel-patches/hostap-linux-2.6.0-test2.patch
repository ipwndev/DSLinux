+	---help---
+	A driver for 802.11b wireless cards based on Intersil Prism2/2.5/3
+	chipset. This driver supports so called Host AP mode that allows
+	the card to act as an IEEE 802.11 access point.
+
+	See <http://hostap.epitest.fi/> for more information about the
+	Host AP driver configuration and tools.
+
+	This option includes the base Host AP driver code that is shared by
+	different hardware models. You will also need to enable support for
+	PLX/PCI/CS version of the driver to actually use the driver.
+
+	The driver can be compiled as modules and they will be called
+	"hostap.o" and "hostap_crypt_wep.o".
+
+config HOSTAP_FIRMWARE

+	---help---
+	Configure Host AP driver to include support for firmware image
+	download. Current version supports only downloading to volatile, i.e.,
+	RAM memory. Flash upgrade is not yet supported.
+
+	Firmware image downloading needs user space tool, prism2_srec. It is
+	available from http://hostap.epitest.fi/.
