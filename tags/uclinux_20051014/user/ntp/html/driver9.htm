<H3>Magnavox MX4200 GPS Receiver</H3>

<HR>
<H4>Synopsis</H4>
Address: 127.127.9.<I>u</I>
<BR>Reference ID: <TT>GPS</TT>
<BR>Driver ID: <TT>GPS_MX4200</TT>
<BR>Serial Port: <TT>/dev/gps<I>u</I></TT>; 4800 baud, 8-bits, no parity
<BR>Features: <TT>ppsclock</TT> (required)

<H4>Description</H4>
This driver supports the Magnavox MX4200 Navigation Receiver adapted to
precision timing applications. It requires the <TT>ppsclock</TT> line
discipline or streams module described in the <A HREF="ldisc.htm">Line
Disciplines and Streams Modules</A> page. It also requires a <A
HREF="gadget.htm">gadget box</A> and 1-PPS level converter, such as
described in the <A HREF="pps.htm">Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal
Interfacing</A> page.

<P>This driver supports all compatible receivers such as the 6-channel
MX4200, MX4200D, and the 12-channel MX9212, MX9012R, MX9112.

<A HREF="http://www.leica-gps.com/">Leica Geosystems</A> acquired
the Magnavox commercial GPS technology business in February of 1994.
They now market and support former Magnavox GPS products such as the
MX4200 and its successors.</P>

<H4>Operating Modes</H4>
This driver supports two modes of operation, static and mobile, controlled
by clock flag 2.

<P>In static mode (the default) the driver assumes that the GPS antenna
is in a fixed location. The receiver is initially placed in a "Static,
3D Nav" mode, where latitude, longitude, elevation and time are
calculated for a fixed station. An average position is calculated from
this data. After 24 hours, the receiver is placed into a "Known
Position" mode, initialized with the calculated position, and then
solves only for time.

<P>In mobile mode, the driver assumes the GPS antenna is mounted on a moving
platform such as a car, ship, or aircraft. The receiver is placed in "Dynamic,
3D Nav" mode and solves for position, altitude and time while moving. No
position averaging is performed.

<H4>Monitor Data</H4>
The driver writes each timecode as received to the <TT>clockstats</TT>
file.  Documentation for the <CITE>NMEA-0183</CITE> proprietary
sentences produced by the MX4200 can be found in
<A HREF="mx4200data.htm">MX4200 Receiver Data Format</A>.
