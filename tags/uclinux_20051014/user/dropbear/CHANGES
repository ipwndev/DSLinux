0.43 - Fri Jul 16 2004 17:44:54 +0800

- SECURITY: Don't try to free() uninitialised variables in DSS verification
  code. Thanks to Arne Bernin for pointing out this bug. This is possibly
  exploitable, all users with DSS and pubkey-auth compiled in are advised to
  upgrade.

- Clean up agent forwarding socket files correctly, patch from Gerrit Pape.

- Don't go into an infinite loop when portforwarding to servers which don't
  send any initial data/banner. Patch from Nikola Vladov

- Fix for network vs. host byte order in logging remote TCP ports, also
  from Gerrit Pape.

- Initialise many pointers to NULL, for general safety. Also checked cleanup
  code for mp_ints (related to security issues above).

0.42 - Wed Jun 16 2004 12:44:54 +0800

- Updated to Gerrit Pape's official Debian subdirectory

- Fixed bad check when opening /dev/urandom - thanks to Danny Sung.

- Added -i inetd mode flag, and associated options in options.h . Dropbear
  can be compiled with either normal mode, inetd, or both modes. Thanks
  to Gerrit Pape for basic patch and motivation.

- Use <dirent.h> rather than <sys/dir.h> for POSIX compliance. Thanks to Bill
  Sommerfield.

- Fixed a TCP forwarding (client-local, -L style) bug which caused the whole
  session to close if the TCP connection failed. Thanks to Andrew Braund for
  reporting it and helping track it down.

- Re-enable sigpipe for child processes. Thanks to Gerrit Pape for some
  suggestions, and BSD manpages for a clearer explanation of the behaviour.

- Added manpages, thanks to Gerrit Pape.

- Changed license text for LibTomCrypt and LibTomMath.

- Added strip-static target

- Fixed a bug in agent-forwarding cleanup handler - would segfault
  (dereferencing a null pointer) if agent forwarding had failed.

- Fix behaviour of authorized_keys parsing, so larger (>1024 bit) DSA keys will
  work. Thanks to Dr. Markus Waldeck for the report. 

- Fixed local port forwarding code so that the "-j" option will make forwarding
  attempts fail more gracefully.

- Allow repeated requests in a single session if previous ones fail - this fixes  PuTTY and some other SCP clients, which try SFTP, then fall-back to SCP if it
  isn't available. Thanks to Stirling Westrup for the report.

- Updated to LibTomCrypt 0.96 and LibTomMath 0.30. The AES code now uses
  smaller non-precomputed tables if DROPBEAR_SMALL_CODE is defined in
  options.h, leading to a significant reduction in the binary size.

0.41 - Mon Jan 19 2004 22:40:19 +0800

- Fix in configure so that cross-compiling works, thanks to numerous people for
  reporting and testing

  thanks again to Ricardo Derbes

- Fix for compiling with --disable-syslog, thanks to gordonfh

- Various minor fixes allow scp to work with irix, thanks to Paul Marinceu for
  fixing it up

  code (thanks to Frédéric Lavernhe for the report and debugging, and Bernard
  Blackham for his suggestion on what to look at)

  clients. Thanks to Marian Stagarescu for the bug report.

0.38 - Sat Oct 11 2003 16:28:13 +0800

- Default hostkey path changed to /etc/dropbear/dropbear_{rsa,dss}_host_key
  rather than /etc/dropbear_{rsa,dss}_host_key

  binaries or small binaries

- Allow for commandline definition of some options.h settings
  (without warnings)

- Be more careful handling EINTR

- More fixes for channel closing

  Trent Lloyd <lathiat at sixlabs.org> and
  Zach White <zwhite at darkstar.frop.org>

  Thanks to Shig for them.

- Improved the closing messages, so a clean exit is "Exited normally"

- Added some more robust integer/size checking in buffer.c as a backstop for
  integer overflows

- X11 forwarding fixed for OSX, path for xauth changed to /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth

- Channel code handles closing more nicely, doesn't sit waiting for an extra
  keystroke on BSD/OSX platforms, and data is flushed fully before closing
  child processes (thanks to 
  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cristian.ionescu-idbohrn at axis.com> for
  pointing that out).

- Changed "DISABLE_TCPFWD" to "ENABLE_TCPFWD" (and for x11/auth) so
  "disable DISABLE_TCPWD" isn't so confusing.

- Fix authorized_keys handling (don't crash on too-long keys, and
  use fgetc not getc to avoid strange macro-related issues), thanks to
  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cristian.ionescu-idbohrn at axis.com> 
  and Steve Rodgers <hwstar at cox.net> for reporting and testing.
