GNU sed 3.02 is now available.  It fixes a bug in the parsing
of character classes and two small packaging glitches that
were in version 3.01.

Sed is a "stream editor" -- used for scripted data transformations,
such as transforming a data stream within a pipeline.

Copies can be obtained by ftp from ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/sed-3.02.tar.gz
and from other sites (see the list of mirror sites at the end of
this message).
