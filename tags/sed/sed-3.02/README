This is version 3.02 of the GNU implementation of the POSIX
stream editor `sed'.  (3.01 had a small but important bug
in character-class parsing.  3.00 was a short-lived rx-based
release that was yanked due to various problems.  2.05 is the
most visible predecessor to 3.01.)  It fixes several bugs, has
minor performance improvements, features a major re-organization
of the code, and has many portability enhancements.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.

The file README.boot gives instructions for making a "bootstrap"
version of sed on systems which lack any pre-existing and working
version of sed.

The file djgpp/README contains instructions for building sed
on DOS based systems using the djgpp compiler and its associated
tools.

See the file BUGS for instructions about reporting bugs.
