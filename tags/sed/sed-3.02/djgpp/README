This directory holds files required to build GNU Sed for
MS-DOS/MS-Windows using DJGPP tools.

1.  Prerequisites
    =============

    To configure and build GNU Sed, you will need to install the
    following:

      - The basic DJGPP development environment (gcc, Binutils, and
        djdevNNN.zip, where NNN is the version number);

      - A port of GNU Bash (make sure you have sh.exe as a ``symlink''
        to bash.exe);

      - A port of GNU Make version 3.75 or later;

      - Auxiliary packages: GNU Fileutils, Textutils, Grep, and
        Diffutils;

      - A port of Sed.

    All of the above should be available from the DJGPP sites on
    SimTel.NET mirrors, in the v2gnu directory.

2.  Bootstrapping Sed
    =================

    If you cannot get hold of a working Sed, you can use the
    bootstrap.bat batch file to build a temporary version, suitable
    for running the configure script and the Makefiles it creates.
    bootstrap.bat requires only the compiler, the linker, and the C
    library.  Once bootstrap.bat finishes, install the produced
    sed.exe somewhere along your PATH, build a production version like
    explained below, and install it instead of the temporary one.


3.  Configuring
    ===========

    To configure Sed for DJGPP, run the config.bat batch file from the
    top directory, like this:

		djgpp\config

    If you are building Sed from another directory, supply the Sed
    source directory as an argument to config.bat:

		d:\src\sed-3.01\djgpp\config d:/src/sed-3.01

    (Note the forward slashes: you MUST use them, or configuration
    process might fail.)

    config.bat will set some variables, update several files, then run
    the configure script via Bash, and create config.h header and
    Makefile's in various subdirectories.


4.  Compiling
    =========

    To compile, just type "make [Enter]".  This builds the Sed
    executable.


5.  Testing
    =======

    This distribution has a test suite.  To run the tests, type
    "make check CMP='diff -c'".  This requires a Diff program (from
    Diffutils, see above).  All tests should succeed.


6.  Installation
    ============

    To install, copy sed.exe to some directory along your PATH.  Then
    copy the Info docs file doc/sed.info into your Info directory and
    run the install-info program to update your info/DIR file:

	install-info --info-dir=%DJDIR%/info %DJDIR%/info/sed.info

    (Replace %DJDIR% with the full path to the root of your DJGPP
    installation tree.)

    Alternatively, you could say "make install" and have Make do the
    entire installation routine for you.


    Enjoy,
