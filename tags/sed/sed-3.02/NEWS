Sed 3.02

Fixed a bug in the parsing of character classes (e.g., /[[:space:]]/).
Corrected an omission in djgpp/Makefile.am and an improper dependency
in testsuite/Makefile.am.

Sed 3.01

This version of sed mainly contains bug fixes and portablility
ehancements, plus performance enhancements related to sed's handling
of input files.  Due to excess performance penalties, I have reverted
(relative to 3.00) to using regex.c instead of the rx package for
regular expression handling, at the expense of losing true POSIX.2
BRE compatability.  However, performance related to regular expression
handling *still* needs a fair bit of work.

One new feature has been added: regular expressions may be followed
with an "I" directive ("i" was taken [the "i"nsert command]) to
indicate that the regexp should be matched in a case-insensitive
manner.  Also of note are a new organization to the source code,
new documentation, and a new maintainer.

Sed 3.0

This version of sed passes the new test-suite donated by
Jason Molenda.

Overall performance has been improved in the following sense: Sed 3.0
is often slightly slower than sed 2.05.  On a few scripts, though, sed
2.05 was so slow as to be nearly useless or to use up unreasonable
amounts of memory.  These problems have been fixed and in such cases,
sed 3.0 should have acceptable performance.
