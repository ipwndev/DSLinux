TODO file (? means the feature may be implemented, but not definitely)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For version 1.4:
- UTF-8 support.
- Support for Pico's paragraph searching ability.
- Undo/Redo key?
- Rebindable keys?
- Keystroke to implement "Add next sequence as raw" like vi's ^V.
- Spell check selected text only.
- Make "To line" (^W^T) and "Read from Command" (^R^X) re-enter their
  parent menu when their keystroke is entered a second time (^W^T^T and
  (^R^X^X)(requires figuring out when to keep cursor pos and when not
  to).
- Fix resetstatuspos global which we shouldn't have.

Old requests:

For version 1.2:

  it.) [DONE]
