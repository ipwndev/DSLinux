How to use the KConfig class
============================
These thoughts are by no means complete or decided on forever, more accurate
and up to date information can be found on http://developer.kde.org

- Retreive the KConfig object from KApplication.  The correct way to do this is
  to use the KApplication::getConfig() method.
- Read values with readFOOEntry. Where FOO is the type of entry you wish to
  read (see the documentation on developer.kde.org for more info on this).
  The keys are searched for in the following files (sorted from least to
  highest priority):
	$KDEDIR/share/config/apprc    (global configuration dir)
	$HOME/.kde/share/config/apprc (local configuration dir)
  $KDEDIR is by default /usr/local/kde/, or in precompiled packages
  /opt/kde/. 
- Only keys that are in the current group will be found. After
  constructing a KConfig object, the current group is "" aka "the
  default group". You can set the group with setGroup(). A group is
  specified in a config file with the group name in brackets, the
  left bracket must be in column 0.
- Write values with writeEntry. writeEntry only writes to memory; the
  data is written to disk when you call sync() explicitly or when you
  destroy the KConfig object. The entries are always written to the most
  specific writeable config file.

How to use the kconfigtest test program
=======================================
- (The test program has been moved to the test directory.)
- You can find information about the last operation in the info field
at the bottom of the window.
- Enter a key left to the "=" character and press enter. If there was
entry with this key in the current group, the corresponding value will
be shown in the field right to the "=".
- To change the current group, enter a new group name in the group
field and press enter. To return to the default group, just clear the
field and press enter again.
- To provide an application-specific config file, enter its name in
the edit field in the first line and press enter.
- If you have changed the group or app config fields, you have to to
the key field and press enter there in order to see the effects your
changes may have on the key search.
- To write an entry, enter the value in the value field right to the
"=" and press the write button.
- To quit the application, press the quit button (now, this was easy!)
