/**
 * KNewPanner is a simple widget for managing two children which
 * are seperated by a draggable divider. The user can resize both
 * children by moving the bar. You can also label the two children
 * and the labels will be adjusted as the divider is moved.
 *
 * This widget is considerably easier to use than the old one, simply
 * set the minimum and maximum sizes of the two children then call
 * activate(). Note that the widgets to be panned should be children
 * of the panner widget.
 *
 * This widget fixes a number of design
 * problems in the original KPanner class which show up particularly
 * if you try to use it under a layout manager (such as QBoxLayout).
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: This panner is NOT source or binary compatable with
 * the old one.
