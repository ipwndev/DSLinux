This version of dvdview requires Microwindows 0.89pre8
or later.
To build, first build Microwindows, and install.

You may have to hand-edit some Makefiles to for 
the nano-X -L/net/microwin/src/lib -lnano-X.
(I'd like to see a configure script modification)

To build dvdview:

cd libvideogfx
make
cd ../src
make

Look at src/demo.sh for demonstration startup.

Regards,

Greg
