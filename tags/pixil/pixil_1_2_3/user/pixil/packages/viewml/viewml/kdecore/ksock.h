 * Addition of packages directory and associated files.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/08/07 21:18:32  jasonk

 * addes ability to set a connect Time Out, breaks binary compatability
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1998/09/01 20:21:33  kulow
 * I renamed all old qt header files to the new versions. I think, this looks
 * nicer (and gives the change in configure a sense :)
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1998/08/22 20:02:47  kulow
 * make kdecore have nicer output, when compiled with -Weffc++ :)
 *
 * Revision 1.17  1998/03/28 11:02:08  kulow
 * undef NULL for egcs's sake
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1998/03/26 22:06:41  torben

 * Torben: Supports UNIX domain sockets now.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1998/01/18 14:39:05  kulow
 * reverted the changes, Jacek commited.
 * Only the RCS comments were affected, but to keep them consistent, I
 * thought, it's better to revert them.
 * I checked twice, that only comments are affected ;)
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1997/12/18 01:56:25  torben
 * Torben: Secure string operations. Use instead of QString::sprintf
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1997/10/21 20:44:53  kulow
 * removed all NULLs and replaced it with 0L or "".
 * There are some left in mediatool, but this is not C++
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1997/10/16 11:15:03  torben
 * Kalle: Copyright headers
 * kdoctoolbar removed
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1997/09/18 12:16:05  kulow
 * corrected some header dependencies. Removed most of them in drag.h and put
 * them in drag.cpp. Now it should compile even under SunOS 4.4.1 ;)
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1997/08/30 08:32:56  kdecvs
 * Coolo: changed the location of the include files to get rid of the

 *
 * Revision 1.2  1997/06/25 14:22:13  ssk
 * Taj: updated some documentation.
