	* html.cpp (parseBody): Initialize KCharsetConversionResult *r to zero
	so as to avoid warnings.

	* htmltoken.h: Remove a trailing comma from an enum statement.
	egcs doesn't like trailing commas for whatever reason.

	* html.cpp, html.h: Implement a scroll blob thingy a la SO5 && MSIE.
	It's ifdef'd out at the moment, cause it needs a bit of work, but the
	binary incompatable changes are already in place and "activated".
