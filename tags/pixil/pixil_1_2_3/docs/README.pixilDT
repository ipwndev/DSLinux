The PIXIL Desktop PIM Component
May 29, 2003

The PIXIL source distribution includes a set of PIM applications meant
to run on the PDA or embedded device, as well as a workstation PIM
application, known as the PIXIL Desktop.  The PIXIL Desktop can
be built to show PIM synchronization between the PDA applications
and the desktop.

The PIXIL Desktop currently requires an external FLTK library, which
allows building for X11 or Win32 (only X11 is currently tested).
Since PIXIL Desktop requires X11, PIXIL PDA must be built using
Microwindows on top of X11 in order to run both simultaneosly and
demonstrate synchronization.  See README.microwindows for more
information on setting up the PIXIL PDA build.

PIXIL Desktop has been tested using FLTK version 1.0.11,
available from http://www.fltk.org.  Currently, PIXIL Desktop
requires GCC version 2.96 or greater.

Building PIXIL Desktop (after building PIXIL PDA normally)

1.  If required, extract FLTK 1.0.11 into it's own directory,
    and build it:

	tar zxvf fltk-1.0.11-source.tar.gz
	cd fltk-1.0.11
	./configure
	make

2.  Edit the PIXIL config file and select the PIXIL Desktop build:
	CONFIG_PIXILDT=y

3.  Specify the external FLTK directory in the PIXIL config file:
	CONFIG_PIXILDT_FLTK=y
	CONFIG_PIXILDT_FLTKDIR="/usr2/fltk-1.0.11"

4.  (Re)make PIXIL
	Type "make".

7.  Install PIXIL:
	Type "make install".

	PIXIL Desktop will be installed into the $(INSTALL_DIR)/workstation
	directory, normally /usr/local/pixil/workstation.

8.  Run PIXIL PDA and Desktop:
	cd /usr/local/pixil
	./run_pda.sh
	./run_desktop.sh


Demonstrating Synchronization

Currently, sync is performed only for Address Book records, and
will only merge records that were created uniqely on either the
PDA or Desktop.  The sync is performed for demonstration using
TCP/IP localhost sockets.

To sync, start PIXIL PDA and Destkop, as described above.
Then start the PDA Sync application in the PIM group.
Select Address Book checkbox, and press synchronize.
The records should be copied across.  To view the records
on the desktop, shutdown the desktop application and restart.
