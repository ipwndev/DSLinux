Using PIXIL with Microwindows
May 29, 2003

The PIXIL Operating Environment and Applications were initially
designed to work within the Microwindows graphical windowing
environment, for an extremely small footprint.  The Microwindows
environment can be setup to run directly on framebuffer, or, for 
demonstration, on top of the X11 desktop environment, for people
without a working framebuffer system.

When PIXIL is configured to run using Microwindows, the determination
of whether to run on framebuffer or X11 is controlled solely through
the Microwindows configuration file, microwin/src/config.

The PIXIL Operating Environment can be setup to run directly
on top of X11, without using Microwindows.  Currently, there is
no support for the PIXIL Screentop Window Manager, as well as
other applications dependent on the Nano-X API.  For more
information, see README.X11.


To run PIXIL under the Microwindows graphical environment, 
you will need to download and build the Nano-X server.  PIXIL
requires Microwindows version 0.90 or later, available from
http://www.microwindows.org (microwindows-src-0.90.tar.gz)

To build Microwindows, do the following:
 
1.  Extract Microwindows into a directory:
	tar zxvf microwindows-src-0.90.tar.gz

2.  Change to the Microwindows source directory:
	cd microwindows-0.90/src

3.  Select your desired configuration:
	There are some premade configuration files located
	in the Configs directory.  Choose one that you want
	and copy it to 'config'. Following are some
	useful configurations:

	Configs/config.pixil	Required PIXIL options for framebuffer operation
	Configs/config.x11	Microwindows on X11 desktop demonstration
	Configs/config.ipaq	Microwindows on iPAQ

	Make sure that you HAVE_FNT_SUPPORT=Y set,
	as the Scheduler PIM application uses loadable fonts.
	Additional image decoders (from the minimal requirements in
	config.pixil) can be selected for the ViewML browser, if desired.

4.  Build Microwindows:
	Type "make".  The Nano-X server will reside in the
	microwindows-0.90/src/bin directory, the libraries in
	microwindows-0.90/src/lib, and the headers in 
	microwindows-0.90/src/include.  These will be automatically
	used when pointed to by the PIXIL configuration file (see below).

5.  Edit the PIXIL config file (config):
	cd <pixil source dir>

	A. Set MW_PREFIX to the Microwindows src directory:
		MW_PREFIX="/usr2/microwindows-0.90/src"
	Edit the config file and change the location of the Microwindows
	prefix MW_PREFIX (in Build Options) to point at your new distro.  Make
	sure you specify the /src directory at the end of the path, e.g.
	if Microwindows was extracted into /usr2/microwindows-0.90, then
	MW_PREFIX="/usr2/microwindows-0.90/src".

	B. Set CONFIG_NANOX=y
	This specifies Microwindows to be used as the graphical windowing
	system.

	C. To build the PIXIL Desktop (the workstation component of
	the PDA PIM suite), set CONFIG_PIXILDT=y.  Note that currently,
	this requires an external FLTK library which runs directly on
	top of X11.  Thus Microwindows must be built using config.x11
	if it is desired to run both the PDA and Desktop simultaneously
	for demonsration of syncing, etc.  See README.pixilDT for
	more information.

	D. Select the installation directory (default /usr/local/pixil):
		INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local/pixil"

6.  Make PIXIL:
	Type "make".

	If the make fails, it's likely due to insidious GCC compiler
	version incompatibilities.  For instance, currently
	the MPEG viewer (CONFIG_DVDVIEW) won't compile using
	"gcc 2.96 Red Hat 7.0", although it will using
	"gcc 2.96 Red Hat 7.3 (2.96-113)".  In this case, set CONFIG_DVDVIEW=n
	and remake. Note that CONFIG_PIXILDT requires GCC 2.96 or
	greater (see README.pixilDT).

7.  Install PIXIL:
	Type "make install".

	Currently, PIXIL must be installed in order to automatically
	put together the directory structure normally compiled for.
	This process will move the PIXIL binaries (not Microwindows)
	into the install directory (normally /usr/local/pixil).

8.  Run PIXIL:
	cd /usr/local/pixil
	./run_pda.sh

9.  Have fun!
