/* void ttopen(void);  Open the tty (attached to stdin) for use inside of JOE
 *
 * (0) Call sigjoe()
 *     There is also 'void ttopnn(void)' which does not do this step.
 *
 * (1) fflush(stdout)
 *
 * (2) Save the current state of the tty
 *
 * (3) Disable CR/LF/NL input translations,
 *     Disable all output processing,
 *     Disable echo and line editing, and
 *     Place tty in character at a time mode.
 *     (basically, disable all processing except for XON/XOFF if it's set)
 *
 * (4) Set this new tty state without loosing any typeahead (by using the
 *     proper ioctl).
 *
 * (5) Store the baud rate in the global variable 'baud'
 *
 * (6) Divide the baud rate into the constant DIVIDEND and store the result
 *     in the global variable 'upc'.  This should come out to the number
 *     of microseconds needed to send each character.  The constant 'DIVIDEND'
 *     should be chosen so that 'upc' reflects the real throughput of the
 *     tty, not the theoretical best throughput.
 *
 * (7) Create an output buffer of a size which depends on 'upc' and the
 *     constant 'TIMES'.  'TIMES' is the number of times per second JOE
 *     should check for typeahead.  Since we only check for typehead after
 *     the output buffer is flushed, 'upc' and the size of the output buffer
 *     determine how often this occurs.  So for example if 'upc'==1000 (~9600
 *     baud) and 'TIMES'==3, the output buffer size is set to 333 characters.
 *     Each time this buffer is completely flushed, 1/3 of a second will go by.

 *
 * (1) write() any characters in the output buffer to the tty and then sleep
 *     for the amount of time it should take for the written characters to get
 *     to the tty.  This is so that any buffering between the editor and the
 *     tty is defeated.  If this is not done, the screen update will not be
 *     able to defer for typeahead.
 *
 *     The best way to do the sleep (possible only on systems with the
 *     setitimer call) is to set a timer for the necessary amount, write the
 *     characters to the tty, and then sleep until the timer expires.
 *
 *     If this can't be done, it's usually ok to 'write' and then to sleep for
 *     the necessary amount of time.  However, you will notice delays in the
 *     screen update if the 'write' actually takes any significant amount of
 *     time to execute (it usually takes none since all it usually does is
 *     write to an operating system output buffer).
 *
 * (2) The way we check for typeahead is to put the TTY in nonblocking mode
 *     and attempt to read a character.  If one could be read, the global
 *     variable 'have' is set to indicate that there is typeahead pending and
 *     the character is stored in a single character buffer until ttgetc
 *     is called.  If the global variable 'leave' is set, the check for
 *     typeahead is disabled.  This is so that once the program knows that it's
 *     about to exit, it doesn't eat the first character of your typeahead if
 *     ttflsh gets called.  'leave' should also be set before shell escapes and
 *     suspends.
